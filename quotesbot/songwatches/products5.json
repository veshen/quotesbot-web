", "Fast forward to today and one of the most prevalent hashtags on Instagram for watches would certainly have to be #speedytuesday. Created by the influential blog Fratello Watches, it started as a series of articles, where they wrote about different variants of the Speedmaster every week. The hashtag over the years caught onto Instagram and today, every Speedmaster collector posts a #speedytuesday shot of their Speedmasters every Tuesday. ", "In fact, #speedytuesday got so big, that it even caught the attention of Omega themselves, the result of which is what you see here.

While the early Speedmasters had a different case, ever since Omega transitioned into their Speedmaster Professional line, it has consistently sported a black dial with rectangular luminous indexes, stick hour and minute hands with an arrow chronograph seconds hand and a 42mm asymmetrical stainless steel case with a black aluminium tachymeter bezel. Even with this limited edition featuring orange accents, it is still instantly recognizable. This Speedy Tuesday Ultraman is powered by the Calibre 1861, Omega\u2019s in-house chronograph that is the descendent of the legendary 861 movement used in Speedmasters since 1969.", "All of these details combine to make up a really great limited edition, and the market agrees with me. Omega has always been great at doing special Speedmasters and collectors are pushing prices up for all kinds of limited editions.

On the right, you have your classic dress pieces such as the Datejust and Day-Date and on the left the ever-popular sports models such as the Submariner, GMT-Master and Daytona. For a long time, the Rolex Yacht-Master was the unloved and unappreciated model of the Crown\u2019s lineup, perhaps because they weren\u2019t that attractive, to begin with. This was the case until 2015- when Rolex decided to revamp the model and introduce what you see here today- The Yacht-Master 116655. ", "This was one of the biggest announcements in BaselWorld 2015 and rightly so as it featured big changes in Rolex. As you may or may not know, Rolex is a hugely conservative brand and they have become known more for evolution rather than revolution, slowly tinkering and improving their watches over decades of research and development. In fact, for example, with all things considered, a Submariner today looks pretty damn similar to the first-ever Submariner released in the \u201950s with its black bezel, black dial and stainless steel case. ", "Moving back onto the topic, the new Yacht-Master 116655 featured one thing that everyone was talking about- the Oysterflex. Using rubber bracelets was nothing new in the watch industry but when Rolex did it- people went nuts. This model was the first ever by Rolex to feature a rubber bracelet and with Rolex being Rolex, it was hugely over-engineered and the technology and quality behind it was truly impressive. ", "Rolex calls this a bracelet and not a strap because inside the rubber are titanium and nickel inserts with ridges moulded inside of the bracelet for a perfect fit. On the wrist, I\u2019m not even surprised to say that this is the best rubber strap ever. Period. ", "On top of this, the 116655 featured a new design language, with an 18k Everose case, a black ceramic bezel instead of the usual platinum one and black maxi dial. It has a water resistance up to 100m and a matching 18k Everose clasp. ", "On the wrist, it really does feel like a luxury sports watch, with the Everose gold and black rubber bracelet juxtaposing to work amazingly well.

It was the line that revived the Tudor name when it was first released back in 2012. When it was released and ever since then, it has struck a chord with collectors and it has consistently been seen as one of the best value watches in the market. The Black Bay was a reinterpretation of Tudor\u2019s rich dive watch history and the brand drew upon design cues from their early Submariners in the 20th century, including the iconic \u2018Snowflake\u2019 hands, the \u2018Big Crown\u2019 no crown guard stainless steel case and the stainless steel riveted bracelet.

The chapter ring, logo and chronometer rating is all in gilt alongside the gold hour marker surrounds, which is also a nice nod to the gold font of the Harrods logo. Another nice touch is the reversal of the depth rating, where Tudor put the feet first (660ft/200m) as a tribute to the \u2018Britishness\u2019 of Harrods. ", "While this is not strictly a limited edition as Tudor doesn\u2019t do limiteds, there is a huge waitlist and Tudor aren\u2019t making many of these.

", "With the straightforward aspects through, pressing the button set in the winding crown reveals that there are actually two apertures at 12 and 6 o\u2019clock that open- and this is where the fun begins. As mentioned, rollers are a very important part of the Maitre du Temps design language and at the 12 o\u2019clock aperture reveals a roller that acts as a day/night indicator and 6 o\u2019clock reveals another roller that acts as the second time zone indicator.", "Opening the panels is a very tactile experience, as the panels that cover the apertures actually sit flush on the dial. Only when you depress the button, it slightly drops beneath the dial and opens up. The rollers are made of gold and have been relief engraved and hand painted.

Each roller holds 6 numbers and once again, when the first roller shifts and spins to the second one, you can feel the mechanism\u2019s movement making for a very immersive, tactile experience.", "As it is a GMT Watch, there is a pusher at 9 o\u2019clock that allows for the mechanism to uncouple and set each timezone independently. Furthermore, the crown has two settings. At its first setting, rotating clockwise sets the moon phase while rotating it anti-clockwise sets the calendar followed by the second setting which sets the time.", "While this is a special watch in its own right with only 50 pieces produced in white gold, this example is an even more special as it is a one-off piece unique made specially for a client.

On top of this, on the bottom left side of the dial is an aperture displaying the year, to take into account leap years and there is a further small aperture below the logo that tells the user not to set the calendar. This is because adjusting a perpetual calendar in between 10PM and 2AM can damage the watch\u2019s mechanism as the calendar function is working at that time. This very handy aperture turns blue during these times so the user knows exactly when to set or not set the calendar.

This Black Bay was made in collaboration with the famous British department store, Harrods and is sold exclusively through the Harrods Fine Watch Room. While I am always skeptical of brands releasing new models with colour changes as the only difference, this one would have to be the exception for me. The Harrods Black Bay comes with a never before seen green bezel, which is the same iconic green that has represented Harrods ever since its inception and green accents in its depth rating and the tip of the seconds hand. The chapter ring, logo and chronometer rating is all in gilt alongside the gold hour marker surrounds, which is also a nice nod to the gold font of the Harrods logo. Another nice touch is the reversal of the depth rating, where Tudor put the feet first (660ft/200m) as a tribute to the \u2018Britishness\u2019 of Harrods.

The process was spearheaded by General Tom Stafford, who was a former NASA Apollo X astronaut and at the time sat on the board of Omega. He provided great insight as to the type of capabilities the watch would require, and this was further supplemented by the feedback that came from professionals ranging from the Navy Seals to the US Air Force.

The watch looks and feels much more reminiscent of the original X-33 but catered to a more modern taste and with even greater technical enhancements.", "The watch is large at 45mm in diameter, but the all-titanium case means the watch wears light.

In terms of its capabilities, the watch has three different time zones, three alarms, a chronograph and countdown function, and a perpetual calendar. Additionally, the Skywalker integrates a mission elapsed time (MET) and a phase elapsed time (PET), which allows for astronauts to record the time the instant the spacecraft launches. With the PET function, it removes the need for manual calculations to set a timer or an alarm, making it a lot less stressful during high-pressure situations.", "As for the heart of the watch, it is powered by the Cal. 5619, which was developed under an ESA patent license and has a thermo-compensated circuit to negate the undesirable variation that results from changes in the surrounding temperature. The cal. 5619 is hugely important, especially in the context of space because it removes the need for the user to calculate the time elapsed since, or the time remaining until a given event.
