Despite being an entry-level sports model, it is one of the most desired and hardest to get watch from the Patek Philippe boutique today. While the current, time-only Ref. 5167A is the Aquanaut that we all know and love, discerning collectors are quietly looking back to the \u201990s to buy the original Aquanaut- the 5065A. ", "Launched in 1997 to attract a younger crowd, the 5065A was priced as an entry-level Patek Philippe made in stainless steel and equipped with a rubber strap. Marketed as a luxury sport watch and as a younger sibling to the Nautilus, it was not exactly loved when it was first released as it was seen as blasphemous to the identity of Patek Philippe. With that being said, any big change always comes with its opposition, and the 5065A being the first-ever Patek to sport a rubber strap, it was no different.", "Well, we all know how this story plays out. With an appreciation for sports watches, today the Aquanaut is seen much differently, with the original 5065, in particular, being one of the must-haves for any discerning Patek collector. This is because, with any historically important watch, the genesis is always seen as a reference point and something worth collecting. ", "The Patek Philippe 5065A is a simple watch, sized at 38mm, it wears much more like a vintage piece than the current version and sports the newly nicknamed \u2018grenade\u2019 dial due to its distinct large-sized guilloche at the center of the dial. This motif carries on through to the strap, with its rectangular embossing complementing the overall design identity.", "This Aquanaut comes fitted on an army green rubber strap that really adds to its vintage sports look. Furthermore, this particular example comes as a true full set, with all of its boxes and accessories. The 5065A is without a doubt a huge milestone in the history of Patek Philippe and one that will always be collectible."], "productCr": "This Patek Philippe Aquanaut 5065A is in excellent condition.

It is imposing and recognizable, and in my opinion, one of the best statement watches money can buy. ", "The Royal Oak is not only famous for what it looks like, but also how it was introduced. First released in the \u201970s, the original Ref. 5402 was a bold stainless steel watch designed by Gerald Genta that created shockwaves because it was priced the same as a solid gold watch. People just could not accept that a pedestrian material such as steel could be priced so exorbitantly and consequently, it was not very popular.

{"productYear": "2019", "title": "Tudor Black Bay Harrods Edition", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The Tudor Black Bay is an iconic model for Tudor. It was the line that revived the Tudor name when it was first released back in 2012. When it was released and ever since then, it has struck a chord with collectors and it has consistently been seen as one of the best value watches in the market. The Black Bay was a reinterpretation of Tudor\u2019s rich dive watch history and the brand drew upon design cues from their early Submariners in the 20th century, including the iconic \u2018Snowflake\u2019 hands, the \u2018Big Crown\u2019 no crown guard stainless steel case and the stainless steel riveted bracelet. With its vintage roots and that famous Rolex quality at such an attractive price point, it is hard not to love the Black Bay. ", "After quite a few years of production, there is now a whole range of Black Bays varying in colours and case material. That being said, my favourite would certainly have to be this version. This Black Bay was made in collaboration with the famous British department store, Harrods and is sold exclusively through the Harrods Fine Watch Room. While I am always sceptical of brands releasing new models with colour changes as the only difference, this one would have to be the exception for me. The Harrods Black Bay comes with a never before seen green bezel, which is the same iconic green that has represented Harrods ever since its inception and green accents in its depth rating and the tip of the seconds hand. The chapter ring, logo and chronometer rating is all in gilt alongside the gold hour marker surrounds, which is also a nice nod to the gold font of the Harrods logo. Another nice touch is the reversal of the depth rating, where Tudor put the feet first (660ft/200m) as a tribute to the \u2018Britishness\u2019 of Harrods. ", "While this is not strictly a limited edition as Tudor doesn\u2019t do limiteds, there is a huge waitlist and Tudor aren\u2019t making many of these. I have heard of clients waiting well over a year for their piece and the demand is out there. The green bezel is reminiscent of the Rolex \u2018Kermit\u2019 Submariner with its similar green bezel and I would certainly consider this the \u2018Baby Kermit\u2019. ", "For a long time, Tudor has been seen as the \u2018Poor Man\u2019s Rolex\u2019 as when they were first created, their philosophy was to use Rolex cases and outsourced movements to save on cost. The old Tudor Submariners used ETA movements and for awhile the Black Bay did too. Now though, this Black Bay is powered by an in-house self-winding calibre MT5602, housed in a 41mm stainless steel bevelled case and takes on its own design cues without having to follow its big brother.

The sub-dials are systemized within concentric circles and in an obvious hierarchy, with the day, month and date on the outer track of the sub-dial, with the less important leap year indicator, moon phase and 24-hour clock inside it.", "Powered by the legendary 240Q movement, it is an instantaneous perpetual calendar, taking into account the days of each month, including February and the leap year.", "While the 3940 is surely underrated, the 5040 is even more so and a great value proposition for those looking to enter the Patek Philippe Grand Complication club.

Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both of who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "Of all the watches F.P. Journe has ever made, none has caught the public attention more than the Chronometre Bleu. While there are certainly more complicated, rare and special timepieces from FPJ, the Chronometre Bleu is the watch that really made the brand into a household name, into the mainstream. Released in 2009, it was made largely as a response to the 2008 crisis that threatened many businesses around the world. In order to stay afloat, the Chronometre Bleu was priced as an entry-level watch to keep sales going.", "There are several things unique about this watch, most significantly, of course, being the fact that it is made completely out of tantalum, a very unusual material for watches. It is a material that is rarer than gold and it is extremely hard to both mine and machine, making it very expensive to produce. The result is a material that has dark blue and silver tones and something you do not see very often. It is a beautiful look that sits stealthily on the wrist and throws off different hues depending on the light source. On top of this, not only is the Chronometre Bleu is the only watch in the F.P. Journe line-up that is made from Tantalum, but also from a 39mm case. ", "Moving on to the dial, it certainly would have to be one of the most impressive dials out there. The chrome blue dial is super reflective and it is achieved through multiple layers of blue lacquer that is hand applied and polished multiple times. It is very well known that the Chronometre Bleu dial is the most complicated and expensive dial that Journe produces with a high failure rate. The result though is a beautifully enigmatic dial that can look from a deep blue/black to a super-light electric blue.", "It is for all of these reasons that F.P. Journe decided to cut production of the Chronometre Bleu. It was just too expensive for an \u2018entry-level\u2019 piece and as a result, demand for this watch has surged even more. I think for once it is nice that the market has priced this higher than retail because collectors recognize that for years Journe was underpricing the Chronometre Bleu. I would say that this could be the most significant \u2018independent\u2019 watch ever produced as it really put the spotlight on artisanal, independent watchmaking. Today it is very normal to collect independents, but before the Chronometre Bleu, that realm was only reserved for the most hardcore of watch collectors."], "productCr": "This F.P.

This was an aesthetic that was truly something new and it is no surprise that this became one of the brand\u2019s best sellers. ", "Rewinding back slightly, the annual calendar complication was invented and patented by Patek Philippe in 1996 as they realised that there was a gap between a simple calendar watch and the highly complicated perpetual calendar complication. While a simple calendar must be adjusted every month, and a perpetual calendar never needs to be adjusted, even on leap years, an annual calendar sits in the middle, where the user only has to adjust the watch once a year in February, while the mechanism takes care of the 30 and 31 days of the rest of the year.

{"productYear": "2017", "title": "F.P. Journe Centigraphe Souverain", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["Where to begin with F.P. Journe. Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both of who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "What you see here today is one of Journe\u2019s most iconic models- the Centigraphe. Designed to time 1/100th of a second, you can already imagine how complicated this is going to get. There are pushers on the top right-hand side of the case to activate the chronograph, prompting the 10 o\u2019clock sub-dial to start running. Watching this is something very special as you see the foudroyant (flying seconds) run and when you stop the chronograph it can stop anywhere on the sub-dial, allowing the user to record exactly to 1/100th of a second. The other two sub-dials act as a 20 second and 10 minute counter.", "Housed in a 40mm platinum case, there is definitely a nice heft to the watch. I think one of the main reasons why collectors love Journe is because of his signature case. It sits so thin and flat on the wrist and finishes off with lugs that step down and hugs your wrist. Once you strap it on, you\u2019ll understand.", "F.P. Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic. Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through. ", "The purists really love Journe because of his motto \u2018Invenit et Fecit\u2019, which translates from Latin to Invent and Create. To this day, F.P. Journe has stuck to this mantra, where he continues to invent his own in-house movements. Furthermore, everything else is also in-house, even to the point of owning his own case-maker and dial-maker. For a small brand that makes less than 1000 pieces a year, it is really impressive.", "Now, of course, timing to 1/100th of a second is not something we need in our lives, but just like art, it is the complexity and the ingenuity that we appreciate. After all, isn\u2019t the wristwatch in itself an archaic tool? So why not, just go all out? It is for that reason, I think that the Centigraphe is one of the greatest watches that has come out of this century."], "productCr": "This F.P. Journe Centigraphe Souverain is in mint condition.

While the classic black Submariner was introduced and somewhat expected, Rolex had a surprise up their sleeves, also introducing an \u2018LV\u2019 version, with a green bezel and dial. Of course, the world went nuts for it and till this day it remains one of the most desirable Rolex models.

Well, sort of. ", "It is often the case that collectors lament the disparity between what they are looking for and what brands \u2018think\u2019 they want, often resulting in watches that end up ultimately as failures.

", "It\u2019s quite simple really, of all the times new models have been successful, it has always come down to the attention to detail. When Wei Koh, the founder of The Rake and Revolution Magazine wanted to create a special piece from his brand, he worked with IWC to make sure that every detail was executed well. ", "IWC\u2019s rich history producing military timepieces acted as the starting point, with this utilitarian aesthetic really forming the backbone of the brand\u2019s design language today. Specifically, the Mk 11, issued to the British Royal Air Force in the late \u201940s and early \u201950s was the main inspiration behind this Pilot watch. The Mk 11 is perhaps the most iconic military watch that IWC has ever produced and despite a few re-editions, this specific model is the one to get. ", "The most amazing thing about this watch is that they chose to go against the market, and size it at 36mm, making it faithful to the original sizing of the Mk 11. Though it might seem small to some, the long lugs really add presence to the feel of the watch and wears larger overall. Without wanting it to be just another reissue, Wei and IWC decided to use a British Racing Green dial with a bronze case and I must say, the combined colors really work well.", "On top of this, they even went so far as to commission George Cleverly, one of England\u2019s most esteemed shoemakers to produce the NATO straps. The material? Russian reindeer hide that was salvaged from a shipwreck in 1786. Yup, even the strap is special, and over 200 years old. ", "One nice thing about bronze watches is that it\u2019ll develop a patina over time as it oxidizes. This oxidation can be removed easily, but it is part of the joy of a watch like this. Paired with the reindeer strap from George Cleverly, and you get a seriously rugged watch that is also special, with only 150 pieces made.

{"productYear": "1990s", "title": "Patek Philippe 3940J Perpetual Calendar", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The Patek Philippe Ref. 3940 is considered to be one of the most important pieces in Patek\u2019s modern history, as it was the first highly complicated serially produced timepiece with a perpetual calendar alongside the perpetual calendar chronograph Ref. 3970. When looked at in context, the 3940 is significant in the sense that when it was released in 1985, Switzerland was in turmoil. An economic crisis in the Swiss watchmaking industry set upon by the Quartz crisis (or revolution depending on how you look at it), mechanical watches, a significant driver of the Swiss economy, had on paper become redundant. As an indicator of the drastic times and the effects felt, the number of people working in the Swiss watch industry dwindled from 90,000 to around 28,000 in the space of 18 years.", "During this time of uncertainty, Patek Philippe, then headed by Philippe Stern, surprisingly released the 3940 and 3970 as a pair. Big Swiss companies were not making complicated pieces at this time as the decline in the industry meant that there was no spare money for innovative investment but instead only enough to consolidate whatever market share they had left. To release a perpetual calendar and perpetual calendar chronograph at the same time, was certainly a bold move by Patek and the timing could not have been greater as the tide was slowly turning with people realizing the value of mechanical watches. This is partly because looking at a mechanical watch and its movement is a very relatable experience, where you can see how it works, how it is all connected, unlike a quartz watch that is powered by an incomprehensible chipboard. Perhaps it has something to do with a universal appreciation we have for craftsmanship as a whole, but whatever it was, this watch is a significant bedrock as to how far Patek has come today despite the adversities it faced. It is no coincidence that Philippe Stern himself, who despite being in the position to wear any and as many Patek Philippe watches he wished, chose to wear a 3940 every day.", "Stepping back from the contextual significance of the 3940, the watch in itself is a marvel both in its design and movement. Housing the fantastically finished in-house perpetual calendar caliber 240 Q, one of its defining aspects is the integrated off-center micro-rotor, allowing this incredibly complicated watch to come in at an unbelievably slim 9mm. In order to ensure that a rotor that small could power the watch, it was made in 22k gold, with the extra weight providing more force to wind the watch.", "Making a perpetual calendar is no easy task, with 275 different parts and as testament to this, at the time it was released, there were only two people in the manufacture allowed to make watches this complicated. Sure, a perpetual calendar does not enjoy the same status as a chronograph, despite being more difficult to manufacture, as it lacks the tactile experience. But for a watch to have a memory of 4 years, accounting for the days in every month including February and the leap year, involves a large measure of skill. Add a moon phase and 24-hour clock on top and you start to understand the complexity of this.", "The aesthetics of the watch is an exercise in restraint, a timeless design combining the need for legibility with a beautiful symmetry of subdials. It has a white opaline dial with yellow gold applied index markers and dauphine hands. Each sub-dial provides two sets of information, with the 3 o\u2019clock sub-dial showing the leap year indicator and the day of the week, the 6 o\u2019clock sub-dial showing the enamel moon phase and the day of the month, and finally the 9 o\u2019clock sub-dial showing the 24-hour clock and the month. The sub-dials are systemized within concentric circles and in an obvious hierarchy, with the day, month and date on the outer track of the sub-dial, with the less important leap year indicator, moon phase and 24-hour clock inside it.\u00a0 A cool little quirk of these 3940\u2019s is in the 24-hour subsidiary dial. In what looks to be discoloration, the orange tint of the bottom half is actually a subtle indicator to show that it is night-time.", "The 36mm curved case sits proportionately elegant on the wrist and its ultra-slim profile completes what is perhaps one of the most understated and elegant timepieces. This watch comes with the angular tang buckle, which I much prefer than the more ornamental Calatrava deployant clasp.", "While it is true that the 3940 does not shout out, it is for this reason I love the watch so much. This idea that you can wear this watch with barely anyone noticing, but you yourself knowing you have something truly special on is very, very appealing to me. There is a real purity to the design where perfect symmetry was achieved, balancing both undeniable elegant aesthetics with a fantastic movement. It is no wonder this watch was in production from 1985-2006, one of the longest run in Patek\u2019s history.", "(Several years ago, I wrote about the Patek Philippe 3940 here (", ") and it was one of my most personal articles due to the fact that I myself own a piece, which was passed down to me by my father. This written description is from that article and while the 5040 is a different watch, it holds a lot of the same principles as the 3940 as shares the same complication and movement as I feel it illustrates why this is such a fantastic watch very well.)"], "productCr": "This Patek Philippe 3940J is in excellent condition.

In fact, there is such a huge appreciation for independents today that is has become somewhat mainstream within collecting circles to own at least one watch from an independent brand.

", "To add some context, Daniel Roth was one of the most talented watchmakers of his generation and was responsible for many things you see today but do not realize. For one, he was a leading figure that established the design language of Breguet dress watches that you see today. In the \u201960s and \u201970s, Breguet had become a below-average watch brand with no future, until they were acquired by Chaumet, who in turn brought in Daniel Roth to lead the helm. The reference 3130, with its guilloche dial and its straight lugged case, set the tone for Breguet and was created by Daniel Roth. Moreover, he played a significant role in producing complicated movements for Lemania who may I remind you up until recently still provided the likes of Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin with chronograph calibers. ", "Looking closer, you will see the beautiful attention to detail on the watch, with a vertical guilloche dial reminiscent of his days in Breguet and a beautifully symmetrical design layout. The depth of the dial achieved through the recessed sub-dials is stunning and complemented by the elegant radial Roman numerals and blued steel hands. ", "I truly think that these Daniel Roth watches are hugely under-appreciated and it is a tragedy that the man himself does not get the recognition he deserves. Due to bad business decisions, several takeovers and just pure bad luck, the brand Daniel Roth eventually ended up with Bvlgari, who today absorbed his distinctive case shape and branded it under their own. Compared to the original Roth pieces, which were elegant, understated and beautiful, today\u2019s reiteration by Bvlgari is a far cry from that- oversized and gaudy. It does make me sad to see such a great watch brand tarnished, but I am sure it will be a matter of time before his great work is appreciated again.

Partly due to stereotypes and prejudice, Seiko as a brand has often been shunned as inferior to Swiss watchmaking when they were actually making watches that were just as good if not better. The SBGW 253, released in 2017 as a celebration of the Grand Seiko name, is a testament to this. ", "Made in a limited edition of 1960 pieces, the SBGW253 is a reissue of the original Grand Seiko that was released in 1960. Though they have reissued this model before in 2011, the newer version features a larger 38mm case with the most desirable being this one, made in stainless steel. ", "What Grand Seiko does better than any of its competitors is its attention to detail and respect to its heritage. While we often see reissues these days from many brands, they always fall short on the details, with wrong proportions and corner-cutting. With the SBGW253, I don\u2019t think I can fault anything about it. ", "The 38mm stainless steel case is perfectly proportionate and faithful to the original, despite the upsize. From its beveled lugs to the 11.2mm profile of the case, all of the details are spot on. Even the engraved gold Grand Seiko lion on the case back and the vintage-styled buckle are executed perfectly. The polar white dial is no different, adopting the old school style Grand Seiko logo font.", "The finishing as expected from Grand Seiko is perfectly done with their Zaratsu style of finishing on the case and hands. Derived from sword-making tradition, Zaratsu polishing is used by Grand Seiko to produce their signature distortion-free mirror finishing.

{"productYear": "2003", "title": "Omega Speedmaster Snoopy Award", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["While the Omega Speedmaster was created as a racing watch, with its chronograph function and tachymeter scale, today this has long been forgotten and instead has become more famous for its exploits in space. Known as the \u2018Moonwatch\u2019, the Omega Speedmaster Professional made history by being flight-qualified by NASA for all manned space flights and becoming the first watch worn on the moon when it was on the wrists of astronauts during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. ", "As a result, the Speedmaster has become a cult icon, and it's hard not to see why. Collectors can buy into such a great story and with a generation that grew up idolizing space travel and astronauts, this watch would certainly have to be one of the most important wristwatches ever made. ", "With racing and space being the central themes of the Speedmaster, you might be wondering why Omega released a \u2018Snoopy\u2019 limited edition and how it has a place in the Speedy lineup. Well, it actually has a lot to do with it, and specifically with space travel. In the \u201960s, NASA chose the Snoopy character, created by Charles M. Schulz to be one of its icons. NASA employees even got sterling silver Snoopy pins as a gift from the company as a sign of appreciation back then and for whatever reason, Snoopy has always had an association with NASA.", "In 2003, Omega decided to commemorate this by creating the first limited edition Snoopy Speedmaster, which is what you see here today. With a cute cartoon of Astronaut Snoopy on the 9 o\u2019clock sub-dial, and a beautifully animated case back, today these are one of the hottest limited edition Speedmasters out there. With a limited run of 5,441 pieces, I think a reason why collectors love this so much is part to do with the quirky story and also the fact that most collectors grew up with Snoopy as an icon.", "Regardless of why, I do think it is quite cool that you have, on one hand, quite a serious watch in the Speedmaster but on the other a lighter and more fun side to it with the snoopy cartoon on the dial.
