{"productYear": "2019", "title": "Patek Philippe Aquanaut Chronograph 5968A", "productPrice": "$130,000.00", "productDescription": ["The Patek Philippe Aquanaut needs no introduction. Launched in 1997 to attract a younger crowd, it was priced as an entry-level Patek Philippe made in stainless steel and equipped with a rubber strap. Marketed as a luxury sport watch and as a younger sibling to the Nautilus, it was not exactly loved when it was first released and it was seen as blasphemous to the identity of Patek Philippe. Well, that didn\u2019t last very long. Fast forward to today and it is, without a doubt, one of the hottest offerings from the manufacture. ", "I am sure all of you would know by now, that perhaps after the Nautilus, the Aquanaut is the hardest model to buy at retail with crazy waitlists. It is no secret that you have to buy many pieces from Patek before they will even let you onto the waitlist. What you may not know though, is that the example you see here today is even scarcer and more in-demand than some of the Nautilus models out there.", "Introduced only in 2018, Patek Philippe unveiled the 5968A- an Aquanaut with a chronograph function. It was only a matter of time before Patek did this and it was certainly long-awaited. Using the same CH 28-250 C movement as the Nautilus chronograph, this is a serious watch and as a result, can no longer be considered the \u2018younger sibling\u2019 of the Nautilus. Furthermore, as it is incredibly difficult to be allocated a piece, and with currently only a 2-year production run so far, there are far fewer examples of these on the market than other sought after Pateks.", "On the wrist, it\u2019s 42mm case sits nicely and has some nice weight and heft to it. The most distinctive feature of this watch, of course, is the use of orange both on the strap and the accents on the dial. The Aquanaut was always meant to be a sporty and young watch, and somehow, Patek has managed to make this piece work with the bright orange not coming off tacky at all. I can imagine wearing this on holiday, on the beach or just during the weekend at a barbecue. I\u2019m really not one for bright colors but somehow, this watch has managed to convince me otherwise. What is nice as well, is if you do not feel like the orange, this watch also comes with an uncut, brand new black rubber strap to tone things down a bit when you need to, but for me- it has to be orange.", "The 5968A is just as versatile as any sports watch out there and perfectly encapsulates the term \u2018luxury sport\u2019 watch. I am sure you didn\u2019t need to read the above for you to decide whether you love this piece or not. It is one of the most in-demand watches produced today and the perfect do-anything watch."], "productCr": "This Patek Philippe Aquanaut 5968A is in excellent condition. The case is in mint condition with no dings or dents. This watch comes as a full set with all of its accessories including its inner and outer box, papers, and manual.

In the automotive world, you have Ferrari, in the world of jewelry you have Tiffany & Co., and in the world of horology, you have Patek Philippe. Situated at the zenith of watchmaking for well over a century, Patek Philippe has created some of the most historically significant timepieces of all time.", "In typical Patek Philippe fashion, their timepieces are functional, excellently made, and objectively beautiful, and one such watch that exemplifies this is the ref. 5170. Constructed of platinum and featuring baguette diamond hour markers and an incredibly executed dial, this is a timepiece that both, flies under the radar and packs a serious punch for those that give it a second glance.", "The star of the ref. 5170 is, without a doubt, its dial. Offered with a graduated blue to black dial, which is designated on the Certificate of Origin as \"bleu degrade noir\", the ref. 5170 has to be experienced in the metal to be truly appreciated. The polymerization of its blue to black gradient, a sunburst finish, and grooved chronograph subdials provides one of the most visually appealing dials of any timepiece. In addition to this, as alluded to, the hour markers are baguette diamonds, further enriching the already graceful dial that extra bit and subtly hinting at the luxurious foundations upon which Patek Philippe has been built upon.", "While objectively I\u2019d say that this is a very beautiful watch, the desirability of it is further emphasized by its rarity. Patek Philippe didn\u2019t make and sell many 5170s, but this particular platinum version goes above and beyond that as it was only produced for two years between 2017 and 2019, before being discontinued altogether. I do think that this particular variant of the 5170 is a sleeper and one that will be insanely collectible once people start to realize it. ", "While not overly complicated, the ref. 5170 perfectly captures everything that a Patek Philippe timepiece is. Gorgeously designed and fantastically finished, the attention to detail on display here is second to none. It is only through appreciating timepieces like the ref. 5170 does it become blatantly obvious why Patek Philippe resides within the Holy Trinity, as watchmakers par excellence.

Framed in a 41mm x 11.45mm round white gold case, the ref. 5172G features a grainy, pared-back navy blue dial with white gold, applied Arabic numerals, syringe hands, and two subdials found just below the 3 to 9 o'clock hemisphere- one the running seconds and the other the chronograph 30-minute counter. With a tachymeter scale around its periphery, the ref. 5172G's dial is legible, functional, and downright stunning.\u00a0", "The ref. 5172G's white gold case enhances its vintage-inspired aesthetic far beyond the reach of its dial. With its fluted lugs, stepped mid-case, and pump pushers, it is remarkably reminiscent of the 1940s Patek ref. 1463. With their sunburst decoration on their tips, the ref. 5172's pump pushers are directly inspired by its predecessor, while its crown is a slight departure thanks to its flatter and more ergonomic profile, which offers a hint of modern design to the timepiece.\u00a0", "Beyond its incredible construction and gorgeous dial, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of manual-wind chronograph movements is found in the ref. 5172G, as exhibited by its sapphire crystal caseback. Featuring a 65-hour power reserve, a vertical clutch, a column wheel assembly, and Patek's impeccable finishing, the CH 29-535 PS took five years to design and create with six patents found within. An incredible testament to Patek's ingenuity, this movement is a wonderful reminder of Patek's horological merit. While the ref. 5172G might fly under the radar; a second glance will reveal the depth of detail found in this watch, from its case to its pushers, to its movement and beyond. A fantastic exhibition of Swiss watchmaking, this isn't your typical dress chronograph; this is what every other dress chronograph wishes it could be."], "productCr": "This Patek Philippe Chronograph 5172G is in mint condition.

One of the early pioneers of the independent movement, Vianney Halter existed before collecting independents a trend. Small scale and taking his time, he has become known today for his distinctive aesthetic. ", "This is the Vianney Halter Classic, one of his most iconic, next to the more complicated Antiqua. A time only piece, it is housed in a 36mm 18k white gold case and features real rivets on the edge of the case along with a studded crown. Two nibs on the top and bottom of the case connect the lugs which hold the strap, rounding off this undoubtedly steampunk style watch. The case is finished with a circular brushing at the top and polished sides, adding a nice depth to the overall look. Wearing and winding the watch, I found it to be a very pleasant tactile experience, from the grip of the studded crown and touching the different surfaces of the watch. ", "The dial is incredibly beautiful on this Classic, with radial stylized Arabic numerals sitting atop a circular brushed silver surface. Towards the center of the dial, there is contrast with the graining and this is topped off with the delicately beautiful curved blued hands. ", "Powering this watch is a heavily modified Lemania 8810 with a mystery \u2018sapphire\u2019 rotor that allows the user to see the movement undisturbed. There are weights on the periphery of the rotor to allow effective oscillation and the movement looks simple but is nevertheless expertly finished with curved angles along the way.

Launched five years after Lange was re-established by Walter Lange, the Datograph culminated in years of laborious research and development. Bearing in mind, this was a period when brands like Rolex, Patek, Audemars Piguet, Vacheron Constantin, and so many other famous watchmakers were still using third-party chronograph movements from brands like Zenith and Lemania. The A. Lange & Sohne Datograph is the watch that sparked the in-house revolution that is still ongoing to this day.", "A notoriously tricky movement to design and manufacture, the Datograph's chronograph cal. L951.1 movement symbolized the German watchmaker's triumphant return to the apex of horology. Featuring an innovative fly-back feature and a patented jumping minutes counter, the manual-wind cal. L951.1 was as impressive as a chronograph movement could be. Comprised of 405 hand-finished and polished parts, the cal. L951.1 proudly announced both Lange's intent to challenge the predominantly Swiss horological status quo and their belief in the Datograph as a watch that would perform commercially. A movement as finely finished and complicated as the cal. L951.1 was not cheap to produce.", "Hailed by many as the greatest chronograph movement of all time, including the likes of Philippe Dufour who owns one personally, what makes this movement so crazy is just how beautiful it looks. Architecturally, it has an amazing three-dimensionality to it that other chronograph movements lack. With its bridges and plates made out of German silver, the overall tone achieved is much warmer and nicer to look at compared to the often sterile-looking silver-colored Swiss movements. Making a movement is not just about technicality but also about design and proportionality. Topping it off with incredible hand-finished anglage and the classic engraved balance cock, it doesn\u2019t get any better than this. ", "While the Datograph's movement is certainly iconic, its design has become legendary, and for a good reason. Featuring Lange's signature oversized quick-set date apertures, two panda chronograph subdials found at 4 and 8 o'clock, and a stacked tachymeter scale along its periphery, the Datograph's black dial has become deeply ingrained within its overall look. Furthermore, the round 39mm x 11.8mm platinum case found on first-generation Datographs, like the example I have here, has become the quintessential design for this iconic watch. While other metals have since entered the foray, platinum reigns as the most iconic metal used.\u00a0", "Compounded upon by the beautiful case and dial design, the Datograph's movement, finishing, overall build, and position as the watch that forced so many other high-end watchmakers to begin going in-house has enabled it to become a legendary timepiece.\u00a0Offered as a complete full set, the first generation example I have here is a true collector\u2019s piece thanks to the profound impact it has had on both horology and Germany\u2019s best watchmaker."], "productCr": "This A.

As one of the most influential and celebrated jewelry and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability.

What started as a simple Tank watch has evolved to a multitude of equally iconic designs, from the Tank Basculante and the Tank Obus to the Tank Cintree and the Tank Americaine to name a few, Cartier has managed to transpose its original designs into a family of icons. While the Americaine is late to the party, it certainly has its place in Cartier\u2019s rich heritage.", "With only 97 pieces produced, this Cartier Tank Americaine Hong Kong Limited Edition is extremely rare.

{"productYear": "2016", "title": "Vacheron Constantin Overseas 4500V Black", "productPrice": "$28,000.00", "productDescription": ["Originally released in 1996, the Vacheron Constantin Overseas was the revival of Vacheron's first sports watch, the 222. Like many other iconic timepieces, the Overseas has evolved over the years with three distinct generations under its belt. The current generation was recently released in 2016 and features some aesthetic design elements from previous generations, while also featuring modern creature comforts and luxuries that Vacheron has pioneered.\u00a0In my opinion, this current generation is the best Overseas line the brand has ever produced. ", "Perhaps the last accessible high-end stainless steel sports watch, the Overseas competes with the likes of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and Patek Philippe Nautilus in terms of quality, finishing, and engineering, but is currently priced at a steal. For a long time, the Overseas has lived in the shadow of the aforementioned watches but since the revamp in 2016, it has slowly started to stand on its own with qualities that I think, are even better than the Royal Oak or Nautilus. ", "Sized at 41mm and tonneau-shaped with a Maltese style bezel, the case is finished excellently with brushed and polished surfaces throughout the case all the way to each bracelet link. Integrated as all luxury sports watches are these days, the bracelet is perhaps one of the stars of the show. Engineered with an innovative quick-release functionality, the Overseas Maltese cross-inspired integrated bracelet can be swapped in seconds for either of the two straps provided with the watch; a suave Mississippiensis alligator leather strap or sporty textured rubber strap. Furthermore, the Overseas bracelet features an incredible extension system on either side of its hidden butterfly clasp that can provide 2mm on either side of the bracelet's partition. None of the Vacheron\u2019s rivals provides any functionality close to this, quite the opposite actually. The Royal Oak and Nautilus annoyingly having a strap and bracelet-specific references- so if you want your bracelet 5711 with a strap, you just have to buy a whole new watch that allows for it. ", "Dedicated to going the extra mile, the Vacheron Constantin Overseas ref. 4500V features one of the most incredible dials in all of watchmaking. A jet black lacquered dial with white gold indices and silver contrasting logos, this dial provides a monochromatic edge to their Overseas' aesthetic while also being extremely legible with two separate chapter rings, one for the minutes along the dial periphery and one for seconds along the rehaut. The depth achieved from the mirrored lacquer finish is amazing. ", "Featuring satin-brushed finishing along with the majority of its 41mm x 11mm case, the Overseas' polished sides and Maltese cross bezel both pop in conjunction with the incredible black dial. Powered by the stunning in-house automatic cal. 5500 movement, the Overseas ref. 4500V features a 22k gold oscillating weight, 60 hours of power reserve, and a myriad of finishing techniques, all on display behind the Overseas' sapphire crystal exhibition screw-down caseback, which aids in providing 150m of water resistance.", "All in all, it is only a matter of time before the Overseas begins to appreciate in tandem with its Holy Trinity counterparts. In fact, waitlists are growing at boutiques just like how the Nautilus and Royal Oak did a few years ago (hint hint). Relatively accessible at the moment given its incredible craftsmanship and rich heritage, collectors will soon understand the plethora of strengths this timepiece has as a luxury sports watch hailing from one of the big three."], "productCr": "This Vacheron Constantin Overseas 4500V is in good condition.

", "Fast forward to 2006, and Patek Philippe releases the heir apparent to the 3700 \u2018Jumbo\u2019, the 5711. Featuring an ultra-slim 8.3mm case, it is so thin not only for a sport watch but in general, sliding easily under the cuff of a shirt. The dial, offered in blue and white came with the familiar ridged dial and integrated stainless steel bracelet. For a while, you could\u2019ve bought these at the boutique at retail but in the last few years, it is practically close to impossible to buy any Nautilus, let alone this 5711. While on paper the 5711 sits as the cheapest Nautilus you can buy, it is the hardest one to get as this is the reference collectors want the most. ", "Everybody knows that the 5711 fitted with the blue dial is the most popular, but I do believe that the white dialled version is a sleeper. Discontinued one year before the blue 5711 in 2020, it is less common to see a white dial and the polar white colour really pops and adds a huge contrast to the watch that you won\u2019t get with the blue. As with all Nautilus\u2019, it comes with its beautifully finished case and bracelet, with polished bevelled edges contrasting with the brushed overall finish going from the case to every individual link.", "The Patek Philippe Nautilus is really the ultimate luxury sport watch, combining brutalist design elements with an elegant profile and sizing. It is just such a cool watch and with the 5711 in particular, it is as pure as it gets, remaining faithful to the original Genta designed 3700 \u2018Jumbo\u2019 from 40 years ago. ", "With the recent news that the 5711 has finally been discontinued altogether, this has only served to increase the demand for this already hard to get piece. Not only is this now an icon of horology but a discontinued one that will never be made again."], "productCr": "This Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 is in mint condition.

{"productYear": "2000s", "title": "Cartier Rotonde Jour Et Nuit CPCP", "productPrice": "$18,000.00", "productDescription": ["The name Cartier needs no introduction. As one of the most influential and celebrated jewelry and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability. Without taking away from its historical significance, I would say that when it comes to watches, Cartier has always been predominantly known as a \u2018design\u2019 brand rather than a pure watchmaking one, with stunningly iconic models such as the Tank, the Crash, and the Santos all seen as important due to how it looks. In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches, and with this in mind, Cartier decided that it was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux and more. ", "The easiest way to differentiate a CPCP watch was by the dial, with all but one model (Tank Cintr\u00e9e) featuring a \u2018Cartier Paris\u2019 inscription- an ode to its heritage. The dials were always crafted from solid gold and often featured a strong hand-turned guilloche pattern with Cartier\u2019s signature \u2018rosette\u2019 in the middle of the dial beneath the handset. ", "The easiest way to describe in words how the watch works is to separate the top and bottom half of the dial, with the bottom displaying the minutes, and the top displaying the hours. A single, retrograde hand at the bottom displays the minutes, bouncing from the left of the dial back to the right after every 60 minutes, while the top of the dial displays the hours via a rotating disc. In the day time, a sun motif rotates, with the beam that touches the outer track displaying the hours, while in the night time, a moon appears on the wheel, effectively making this a 24-hour indicator and hence the name \u2018Jour Et Nuit\u2019, or \u2018Day and Night\u2019 in English. ", "The CPCP collection ran for 10 years between 1998 and 2008 and I can confidently say it is one of the most significant periods in Cartier\u2019s history. It\u2019s beautiful to see that Cartier was doing \u2018reissues\u2019 before it was even a thing and doing it the right way- respecting the past while producing something that is modern. Not only this but the CPCP models were produced in truly limited numbers, with many having a designated run of 50 to 100 pieces. For those in the Collection Priv\u00e9 that weren\u2019t strictly \u2018limited\u2019, it is estimated that only 250-300 pieces were made for each reference making any CPCP watch out there truly special. ", "Collectors are finally taking notice of this, and Cartier in general as a brand worth collecting. With more knowledge available now, the demand for Cartier has been huge and I only see it getting larger, especially for important references such as those from the CPCP line.

While not the first IWC timepiece made of ceramic, it is the brand's first Pilot's Watch model made of the material.

With its signature rectangle-shaped case, thin profile, and elegant dial, it is as classical a timepiece today as when it was released in 1917.

Remarkably over the century, the Tank model has been reborn into many variants, all with different forms while still managing to maintain its DNA.", "Debuting in 1933, the Tank Basculante took inspiration from the Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso, a double-sided sports timepiece that would swivel within its case to protect its dial. In keeping with this design, the Basculante also turned in its case to protect its dial. However, different from the Reverso, rather than turning on its horizontal axis, the Basculante turned over its vertical axis, allowing it to stand upright in mid-rotation to double as a table clock. All of this was done elegantly via the central jewel of the watch, where the user would flick it open with his/her nail.", "With a desire to release a model that spoke to the original Tank Basculante's heritage, Cartier released the ref. 2390 in the early 1990s with some modern touch-ups and other period-correct details.

After Vulcain released the Cricket, the world's first successful alarm watch, Jaeger-LeCoultre responded with the Memovox. As the battle tore on, the brand developed a dive watch version of the Memovox in 1959, the Deep Sea Alarm, making it the first alarm dive watch ever made. This model then inspired JLC to release the Memovox Polaris in 1968. Featuring the same twin-crown system for winding and setting the alarm and time as the Deep Sea Alarm but with a chunkier case with improved visibility and usability, the Polaris went on to become an iconic dive watch with a practical function that was executed well thanks to its triple-layered ESPA compressor case.", "\u00a0", "In 2008, Jaeger-LeCoultre decided to pay tribute to the very first Polaris with the aptly named \"Memovox Tribute to Polaris\" by releasing a 768 piece limited-edition, historically accurate interpretation of that now-iconic timepiece.

Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both of who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "What you see here today is one of Journe\u2019s most iconic models- the Centigraphe. Designed to time 1/100th of a second, you can already imagine how complicated this is going to get. There are pushers on the top right-hand side of the case to activate the chronograph, prompting the 10 o\u2019clock sub-dial to start running. Watching this is something very special as you see the foudroyant (flying seconds) run and when you stop the chronograph it can stop anywhere on the sub-dial, allowing the user to record exactly to 1/100th of a second. The other two sub-dials act as a 20 second and 10 minute counter.", "Housed in a 40mm platinum case, there is definitely a nice heft to the watch. I think one of the main reasons why collectors love Journe is because of his signature case. It sits so thin and flat on the wrist and finishes off with lugs that step down and hugs your wrist.

With its round 40mm x 12.8mm polished 18kt rose gold case, smooth bezel, and strong lugs, the Master 8 Days certainly portrays itself as quite a regal timepiece, that refrains from the pageantry involved with loud brash designs and allows for great wearability.", "Providing a glimpse into the wonderfully complicated movement beneath, the Master 8 Days features a stunning ivory-coloured dial adorned with case-matching 18kt rose gold dial furniture and applied hour markers.

It is imposing and recognizable, and in my opinion, one of the best statement watches money can buy. ", "The Royal Oak is not only famous for what it looks like, but also how it was introduced. First released in the \u201970s, the original Ref. 5402 was a bold stainless steel watch designed by Gerald Genta that created shockwaves. It was designed as a luxury sport watch and the scandalous part was that it was priced accordingly- the same as an equivalent gold watch of its era. ", "People just could not accept that a pedestrian material such as steel could be priced so exorbitantly and consequently, it was not very popular. It was only after some time that the public saw this as something genuinely original and avant-garde. Today though, in-line with the craze for stainless steel, the Royal Oak is an icon. ", "Of late, while the Royal Oak itself has been immensely in demand, the discontinued perpetual calendars have been right at the top of it. Furthermore, the example here is one of the most special perpetual calendars Audemars Piguet ever produced, featuring a stunning open-worked skeleton dial. Open working has been one of AP\u2019s signatures since the \u201980s and the ref. 25829 is one of its most popular and iconic. Collectors have begun to realize just how special the perpetual calendars are and how rare they are, with extremely low production numbers. ", "With a 39mm case, it sits much better on the wrist than the newer 41mms, with not only better proportions but also being more faithful to the original. In fact, the movement inside this watch is the same you will find on the Jumbo models as it is the legendary JLC Cal. 2120 with a perpetual calendar module built on top. As a result, this watch shares the same thickness as the 15202 with a slightly thicker bezel to accommodate the perpetual calendar module. For such a complicated watch that takes into account how many days each month has, including leap years, this is truly impressive. ", "The open-worked dial is a work of art, beautiful hand finished, giving the wearer insight into the legendary caliber. Despite this, the watch remains legible and simple enough to use.

Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "It goes without saying that F.P. Journe has been one of the hottest brands in the last 12 months, finally gaining the recognition that it deserved all along. With early brass movement pieces hitting records at auction, the rest of the collection has followed. ", "I am very proud to offer the example here today as it is a very important and early Journe. The Octa line is Journe\u2019s self-winding model and while over the years there have been many models based on this movement, the Reserve de Marche is the purest iteration of it all. Featuring a simple time display and power reserve indication, it was one of the earliest models released by the brand, alongside the Chronometre a Resonance and the Tourbillon Souverain. ", "What distinguishes early Journe models from the more common ones is the use of brass in the movements. F.P. Journe only used brass movements up to 2004, switching to complete rose gold calibers after that. As a result of it being produced for only a few short years, these are very rare and hugely desirable by collectors. ", "At the time, buyers had several options to configure their watches, with the choice of rose gold or platinum for the case, and rose, white or yellow gold for the dial. While any brass movement F.P. Journe is considered hard to come by, this particular example is said to be one of the rarest configurations, with an 18k rose gold case and a matching rose gold dial. Around 50-60 examples were produced and you will not see this one very often. ", "All early Journe watches were made in a 38mm case size, as supposed to the 40 or 42mm choice you have today. The 38mm case size is another thing that collectors prefer, and I would agree as it sits on the wrist much more homogeneously. ", "Flip the watch over and you will see the in-house FPJ caliber 1300.3 made of brass. It has a beautiful 22k gold rotor and all parts are hand finished to perfection. It has a 120-hour power reserve, and this is indicated on the dial.", "F.P.

Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown, and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through.

Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "It goes without saying that F.P. Journe has been one of the hottest brands in the last 12 months, finally gaining the recognition that it deserved all along. With early brass movement pieces hitting records at auction, the rest of the collection has followed. ", "What I have here today is an absolutely beautiful example of an early brass 4th generation Tourbillon Souverain. What distinguishes early Journe models from the more common ones is the use of brass in the movements. F.P. Journe only used brass movements up to 2004, switching to complete rose gold calibers after that. As a result of it being produced for only a few short years, these are very rare and hugely desirable by collectors.", "The Tourbillon was the first wristwatch produced by F.P. Journe and it was part of the original lineup alongside the Chronometre a Resonance and the self-winding Octa Reserve de Marche. The Tourbillon Souverain was powered by the Caliber 1498 and featured a remontoir d\u2019egalite crafted from rhodium-plated brass. ", "Coming as a full set and from the original owner who bought this watch new from Sincere Watches in Malaysia in 2003, it was presented to him by Fran\u00e7ois-Paul himself when he came down to Malaysia in 2003 for a dinner hosted by Sincere. As a result, this watch additionally comes with a presentation book featuring all of the models of the time which was signed by Fran\u00e7ois-Paul. The card of authenticity is also signed by the man himself, making this watch just that much more special. ", "The dial on this particular example is very unique and one of the more interesting early dials I have seen. As it comes from the original owner I know for a fact that this piece was never opened and lived its life mostly in the safe in the hot and humid weather of the Tropics. You can see how the dial has aged and developed a patina that no other example will have. ", "Another thing is that the grainy dials shimmer in the light and display a huge range of hues depending on the lighting conditions. It is hard to capture this phenomenon in the photography but it is really something you have to see to appreciate. Later Journes had more refined finishing to the dials and as such lacks the character that these early ones possess.", "At the time, buyers had several options to configure their watches, with the choice of rose gold or platinum for the case, and rose, white or yellow gold for the dial. This example comes in platinum and houses a white gold dial that has oxidized to a yellow tone. ", "All early Journe watches were made in a 38mm case size, as supposed to the 40 or 42mm choice you have today. The 38mm case size is another thing that collectors prefer, and I would agree as it sits on the wrist much more homogeneously. ", "F.P. Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic. Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown, and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through. ", "It is a huge honor to be able to offer this extremely special piece, direct from the original owner based here in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and in a complete set. "], "productCr": "This F.P. Journe Tourbillon Souverain is in excellent condition. It has never been opened or polished before and is a time capsule of how the was presented back in 2003.

Perpetual calendar chronographs. Not much has been left unsaid about this legendary flagship family of watches, and rightly so. Deemed by many not only as the quintessential Patek but also as some of the best watches of all time, they have become graceful lessons in restraint and practicality, in balance and in tradition. The first-ever produced perpetual calendar chronograph by Patek Philippe was in 1941 with the reference 1518 and since then they have only released four more iterations, with the one you see here today, the 5270, the most recent. It goes to show that this reference is taken very seriously, with only five versions (1518, 2499, 3970, 5970, 5270) in nearly 80 years. ", "This particular example is perhaps my favourite iteration of the variations seen so far in the 5270. As Wei Koh said in his article for Revolution \u2018There are gold watches, and there\u2019s the Patek Philippe 5270/1R: where one would expect from Patek Philippe a timepiece with just a touch more flash from a reined expression in gold, there is a slack-jaw moment when first confronted with how the watchmaker is serving up gold in flaming spadefuls here.\u2019 First released in 2018, this is the full-fat 5270R, housed in a rose gold case with a deep black dial, with the watch finished off fitted with a stunning integrated \u2018goutte\u2019 (French for droplet) solid rose gold bracelet. ", "I am absolutely a huge fan of gold and what may not be known, is that Patek Philippe worked closely with Gay Freres in the 20th century to produce a myriad of uniquely design gold bracelets. For instance, when you bought a Ref. 2526 back in the 1950s, you had four bracelet designs you could choose from! So while some might see this as gaudy, I do think there is some continuity with the choice to have a bracelet option in the catalogue. ", "Looking into the business end of the 5270, this is where Patek made headlines when this watch was first released in 2011. The calibre 29-535 PS Q was the first perpetual calendar chronograph made entirely in-house, replacing the Nouvelle Lemania based 27-70 Q used in the older 5970 and 3970. Although the 27-70 Q was an exquisite, top-tier movement, we live in an age where the term \u2018in-house\u2019 has become a selling point for manufacturers and a priority for customers.", "In terms of tradition, this is as pure as it gets. Housed inside the 5270 is a classic column-wheel chronograph, using a lateral clutch engagement so you can see the watch functioning in all of its glory. While there are known drawbacks to a lateral clutch as supposed to a more modern vertical one, Patek opted for the former due to the fact that simply stated, they are architecturally and aesthetically more beautiful. It isn\u2019t always the case that watchmaking is all about technicality, especially in\u00a0", "\u00a0Instead, it is the subtle alternations between the balance of beauty and functionality that truly defines a great movement.", "To be able to see the wheels engage and disengage in the 5270 really is a beautiful thing. This provides a much more immersive experience for the wearer. After all, why have an exhibition case back if there\u2019s nothing to see? Furthermore, it is important to note, that Patek being Patek, they combatted a lot of the downsides of a lateral clutch movement such as hand quivering and backlash through a series of ingenious inventions. This includes a patented tooth profile for the chronograph wheels to reduce wear and prevent tooth tip collisions (which causes hand jumps), a column wheel cap that is actually functional, allowing a more precise adjustment for the clutch lever and a slotted minute counter cam that prevents the second-hand quivering when reset. Above the base calibre, sits a newly developed perpetual calendar module, and at a thickness of 1.65mm, it ensures the watch remains discreet and slim, relative to the level of complications.", "As expected, the 29-535 PS Q is beautifully finished, albeit understatedly. There is nothing superfluous, no flourishes or engravings and that is the way I like it. With expertly finished polished chamfers on all edges and satin-finished flanks, it is aligned with Patek\u2019s pursuit of sophistication and understatement.", "The 41mm case of the 5270 is perhaps my favourite part of the watch, which in my eyes achieved an amazing proportionality and balance. The flared, angular lugs that stick out of the watch are juxtaposed harmoniously with the roundness of the concave bezel. Looking at the side profile, at 12.4mm thick, the rectangular pushers are spaced perfectly, corresponding with the mentioned lugs that stream downwards and narrows at the end. Nothing here is obtrusive as the watch ebbs and flows between fluid shapes and sharp angles, between masculinity and elegance, complementing one another. It is truly a master class in case design. I never thought I\u2019d say this about a watch sized at 41mm, but on the wrist, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it hugged my wrist. The profile really works and it doesn\u2019t look bulky or oversized at all. (That\u2019s coming from someone with a smaller wrist.)", "The dial is unmistakably Patek, with two apertures for the month and day at 12 o\u2019clock, and three recessed sub-dials for the minute counter, seconds counter and moon phase. Using rectangular rose-gold applied index markers, its relationship with the softer shaped Feuille hands is well-balanced. New to the 5270 was the removal of the day/night and leap year indicator from the sub-dials and it was replaced with two apertures that make for a far cleaner look.", "I do think that there is something universally appealing about a rose gold watch with a black dial. This 5270R is further complemented by the tasteful accents of blue in the moon phase and the day/night indicator. There is no doubt that this watch has a huge presence and makes a big statement on the wrist. I always say, it is not what you wear, but how you wear something and when tastefully done, this Patek Philippe 5270R makes for a very classy and elegant watch.", "Note: I wrote an article on the Patek Philippe 5270 back in 2015 for ", " and in this description, I draw heavily from what I wrote then.

While the Royal Oak was designed in this same sense, Audemars Piguet was largely seen as the bad boys of the industry and when Patek Philippe followed suit, clients and critics alike who were used to seeing elegant dress watches were shocked to see that they followed in the footsteps AP.

{"productYear": "2012", "title": "F.P. Journe Souveraine Repetition Minutes", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["Where to begin with F.P. Journe. Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both of who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "The F.P. Journe Souveraine Repetition Minutes is one of the most complicated timepieces that come out of the manufacture and features quite a few technical marvels. Aesthetically, it has the DNA of the Chronometre Souverain, with its familiar stylized Arabic numerals and hobnail guilloche center. What is unique about this reference is that it features a white opaline dial with navy blue numerals. The subtle blue is really beautiful and is reminiscent of the color scheme of antique chinaware. Topping it off, there is an aperture around the 10 o\u2019clock marker that showcases the chiming gongs. ", "A minute repeater has traditionally been seen as the pinnacle of watchmaking and is no easy feat. It was invented back in the day when it was hard to read the time at night and also for times when it was inappropriate to look at your clock. So as a way to tell time, a minute repeater would chime the time with the first singular chimes telling you the hour of the day, the second dual chimes telling you which quarter it was (15, 30, 45) and the final singe chimes telling you how many minutes after the quarter it was, hence giving you the exact time. ", "When the Souveraine Minute Repeater was first released in 2008, it was the thinnest minute repeater ever produced at 8.65mm, so you can imagine how well this sits on the wrist, despite its complication. While it is housed in a traditional F.P. Journe case, what sets it apart is the little lever you see at 10 o\u2019clock, which of course is how you activate the minute repeating function. What is different about this minute repeater is that F.P. Journe adopted flat hammers that he invented so that it can be more compact within the movement. The chimes are louder than your typical repeater as a result and this is further assisted by the fact that it is housed in a stainless steel case as it has a lower density than gold, meaning the sound can be amplified louder.", "F.P. Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic. Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown, and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through. It is for this reason that he is today, one of the most sought after and successful independent watchmakers in the industry. ", "The F.P. Journe Souveraine Repetition Minutes is a truly elegant timepiece and packs a hugely complicated mechanism in a seemingly simple layout. While Journe\u2019s timepieces have skyrocketed in value, this minute repeater has yet to reach those heights, perhaps as not many examples were made at all and it has yet to be discovered."], "productCr": "This F.P.

Constructed of platinum and featuring baguette diamond hour markers and an incredibly executed dial, this is a timepiece that both, flies under the radar and packs a serious punch for those that give it a second glance.", "The star of the ref. 5170 is, without a doubt, its dial. Offered with a graduated blue to black dial, which is designated on the Certificate of Origin as \"bleu degrade noir\", the ref. 5170 has to be experienced in the metal to be truly appreciated. The polymerization of its blue to black gradient, a sunburst finish, and grooved chronograph subdials provides one of the most visually appealing dials of any timepiece. In addition to this, as alluded to, the hour markers are baguette diamonds, further enriching the already graceful dial that extra bit and subtly hinting at the luxurious foundations upon which Patek Philippe has been built upon.", "While objectively I\u2019d say that this is a very beautiful watch, the desirability of it is further emphasized by its rarity. Patek Philippe didn\u2019t make and sell many 5170s, but this particular platinum version goes above and beyond that as it was only produced for two years between 2017 and 2019, before being discontinued altogether. I do think that this particular variant of the 5170 is a sleeper and one that will be insanely collectible once people start to realize.

First released in the \u201970s, the original Ref. 5402 was a bold stainless steel watch designed by Gerald Genta that created shockwaves. It was designed as a luxury sports watch and the scandalous part was that it was priced accordingly- the same as an equivalent gold watch of its era. ", "People just could not accept that a pedestrian material such as steel could be priced so exorbitantly and consequently, it was not very popular. It was only after some time that the public saw this as something genuinely original and avant-garde. Today though, in-line with the craze for stainless steel, the Royal Oak is an icon. ", "This example for sale here is a superb and highly complicated variant of the Royal Oak that not many people are aware of- it is the discontinued Ref. 25820 Perpetual Calendar with a blue dial. While most of the limelight goes to the 15202 Jumbo, the 25820 has been slowly gaining traction in the last 18 months as collectors are realizing how great these pieces are. With a 39mm case, it sits much better on the wrist than the newer 41mms, with not only better proportions but also being more faithful to the original. In fact, the movement inside this watch is the same you will find on the Jumbo models as it is the legendary JLC Cal. 2120 with a perpetual calendar module built on top. As a result, this watch shares the same thickness as the 15202 with a slightly thicker bezel to accommodate the perpetual calendar module. For such a complicated watch that takes into account how many days each month has, including leap years, this is truly impressive. ", "In fact, part of the reason why there is a renewed interest in perpetual calendar Royal Oaks is because AP themselves have been releasing many of their iconic new models with this collection, from the black and white ceramic models, including the most recent open-worked version, and of course the insane RD2 ultra, ultra-thin.\u00a0", "While the current Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar is fairly common, the 25820, especially in blue is extremely rare.

", "It\u2019s all about the Calibre 1510 with this watch and that is where I\u2019ll spend the most time on. The main goal of the Optimum was to create a watch that focused on chronometry in the most efficient and reliable way possible and as a result, there are a whole host of innovations in the calibre that makes it so. Beginning with the signature Journe double-barrel layout, this ensures that energy is provided in a stable manner, further achieved through Journe\u2019s remontoir d\u2019egalite system. Every second the remontoir stores and releases energy, which aids this constant force. On top of this, there is a dead seconds indicator on the movement side, reinforcing the precision ethos of this watch. ", "There is an entirely unique escapement in this watch which Journe calls the EBHP direct impulse escapement and the two wheels manage to function without any form of lubricants, decreasing its wear and tear.

Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic.

Journe through and through. ", "The purists really love Journe because of his motto \u2018Invenit et Fecit\u2019, which translates from Latin to Invent and Create. To this day, F.P. Journe has stuck to this mantra, where he continues to invent his own in-house movements with this Optimum being a testament to that. Furthermore, everything else is also in-house, even to the point of owning his own case-maker and dial-maker. For a small brand that makes less than 1000 pieces a year, it is really impressive.", "While it has been all about the movement with this Optimum, let\u2019s not forget that aesthetically this is still a Journe through and through. With his signature 40mm platinum case, it houses a grey dial with his classic layout.

Journe has only been around for the length of time that it has. Founded in 1999, F.P. Journe burst onto the watchmaking scene with a 20 piece limited run of Tourbillon Souverain Souscription watches that cash-strapped Francois Paul used to finance his brand, just like Abraham Louis Breguet did over 200 years ago. 20 odd years later, however, the F.P. Journe brand has become a horological powerhouse with waiting lists growing ever-longer and auction results growing ever more impressive.", "Here, I have a highly desirable F.P Journe Chronom\u00e8tre Souverain \u2018Havana\u2019 Edition, named as such because of the brown dial it is fitted with. The Chronometre Souverain is the time-only manual winding watch from F.P. Journe and it has been produced in many variants, with different case and dial combinations. It can be said, that without a doubt, the Havana model is one of the most attractive variants and as such, one of the most in-demand. ", "While you may think it is just another brown dial, it should be known by now that F.P. Journe doesn\u2019t do anything the easy way. This Havana dial is made by mixing ruthenium with gold in order to achieve the rich and reflective brown tone of this watch and by doing it this way, the Havana dial achieves a huge amount of depth. This combined with a hobnail, Cloys de Paris pattern in its center, and you get a wonderfully rich brown dial that can be dark in its tone to a light milk chocolate-like color, depending on the lighting conditions.
