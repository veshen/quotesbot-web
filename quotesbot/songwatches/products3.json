{"productYear": "2000s", "title": "Roger Dubuis Sympathie 37 Breguet", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["For a long time, the Roger Dubuis name was thought to be over and irrelevant to collectors. With Dubuis watches of today having garish designs and proportions that are all wrong, it is no wonder why. The truth is, Roger Dubuis, the man, left the company in 2005 and while he was undoubtedly a brilliant watchmaker, he lacked business expertise.", "It is this, and not his watchmaking skills, that caused the brand to be what it is today- devoid of emotion and controlled by business executives with no passion. You see, underneath this sheath of failure lies some of the most beautiful watches ever made. Early Roger Dubuis watches are nothing like what they are today- elegant in their design and finished to the highest standards, these watches rivaled and even bettered contemporaries such as Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet. In fact, collectors have finally started to realize this and as a result, prices have been skyrocketing. ", "An independent brand with aspiration, I have no doubt that today\u2019s indies have Dubuis and other pioneers of his time to thank for laying out the groundwork. Roger Dubuis formed his eponymous brand in 1995 after two decades at Patek Philippe and at the time, it not only took huge courage to start an independent brand but Dubuis had to also operate in an area that wasn\u2019t as mainstream as it is today.", "Constructed of 18kt rose gold, the Sympathies 37mm case is a feast for the eyes. Featuring a vertical satin grain on the caseband and lug profiles with a contrasting high polish on the bezel, thick fixing screws, and lug hoods, the Sympathie is a finely executed timepiece with appreciable attention to detail. Asides from its case, the Sympathies dial also stands out as a unique piece of design. Featuring a tri-tone design, the dial has applied gold Breguet style hour markers and an orange seconds track along its periphery sitting atop a shiny gloss black dial. With rose gold dauphine hands, the dial set up perfectly matches the Sympathies rose gold case, black leather strap, and distinctive rose gold pin buckle. ", "I must say that this is one of the most beautiful dials I\u2019ve seen in a while and when it first came to me I was amazed. The way the light reflects off the dial is reminiscent of vintage gilt gloss dials and the oversized applied Breguet numerals are so distinctive that you can\u2019t help but to keep staring at your wrist. ", "Powered by the automatic Roger Dubuis Cal. RD57, the Sympathie is as elegantly equipped within its case, as it is visually appealing from the outside. On display behind its sapphire crystal caseback, the RD57 is a finely finished piece of horology including black polished screws and swan's neck regulator, gorgeous c\u00f4tes de Geneve motif, and mirrored chamfering throughout. As referenced by the dial signature \"Bulletin D'Observatoire\", a Besan\u00e7on Observatory chronometer certificate from the French capital of watchmaking certifies the accuracy of this movement and goes to substantiate the level of quality on display by these early Roger Dubuis timepieces.", "Each Roger Dubuis model from his time was made in limited editions of 28, making this example extremely special and rare.

With the modern 5711 trading at multiples of its retail and the vintage Jumbo 3700 trading for, even more, most people have been priced out of these examples. ", "Well, good thing Patek had a mid-size sibling to go along the Jumbo back in the day and as a result of these premiums, the prices of these have followed too. The 3800 was introduced at a time when the Nautilus was still seen as a brash, anti-Patek watch. Clients and critics alike were used to seeing elegant dress watches and were perhaps shocked to see that they followed in the footsteps of Audemars Piguet\u2019s Royal Oak when they introduced the 3700 in the 70\u2019s- Not to mention using the same designer in Gerald Genta! Furthermore, watch sizes of that era were much smaller, so to have a 42mm piece was considered hugely oversized and this is where the 3800 fits in, sized at 38mm and more acceptable to the general public. ", "The 3800 is every bit as good as its larger sibling and featuring the same monobloc case with beautiful finishing throughout. Every surface is brushed and polished and when it reflects light it simply looks amazing. The blue dial with its horizontal stripes looks so good in the light and depending on the conditions reflects off different hues of blue, green, black, and grey. It is no wonder blue dials are so hot right now.", "For the longest time, the 3800 Nautilus has lived in the shadow of the \u2018Jumbo\u2019, but as collectors become savvier, knowledgable, and confident, many have realized that they in fact prefer this reference as it suits their wrists better.

It is imposing and recognizable, and in my opinion, one of the best statement watches money can buy. ", "The Royal Oak is not only famous for what it looks like, but also how it was introduced. First released in the \u201970s, the original Ref. 5402 was a bold stainless steel watch designed by Gerald Genta that created shockwaves. It was designed as a luxury sports watch and the scandalous part was that it was priced accordingly- the same as an equivalent gold watch of its era. ", "People just could not accept that a pedestrian material such as steel could be priced so exorbitantly and consequently, it was not very popular. It was only after some time that the public saw this as something genuinely original and avant-garde. Today though, in-line with the craze for high horology, sports watches, the Royal Oak is an icon.

Sized at 37mm, it is essentially the same as the larger size 15400, with the same in-house caliber 3120 at a more accessible size for those with smaller wrists. Royal Oaks have been made in a multitude of sizes for a long time and the 15450 is just a continuation of that tradition. In fact, many collectors I know, who can\u2019t get the 39mm 15202 have instead opted for the 37mm 15450 as the 15400\u2019s at 41mm were just too bulky.

While the brand enjoyed great success in the 18th and 19th century, producing pocket watches for the most influential people in the world, by the mid 20th century, the brand was decrepit and nearly nonexistent. Other than producing the occasional piece here and there, they were predominantly supplying Type 20 watches to the military. In terms of design language, the Type 20\u2019s were a brutish, far cry from the beautifully elegant timepieces that preceded them.

There are reasons for this of course, with questionable watch designs over the years and their dominance in Haute Horlogerie, it was always going to be an uphill battle.

The 16/1860/2 you see here today is the first watch released by Chopard L.U.C. and it was universally praised when it came out.

With a 70-hour power reserve from two stacked mainspring barrels, it also featured a Breguet over-coil hairspring and a swan neck regulator, all contributing towards its precision and power dispersion. The most comparable movement to the 1.96 would have to be the ever-trusty Patek Philippe Caliber 240.

The 17.06\u2019s warm etched copper dial creates a gorgeous visual juxtaposition between the polished 316L stainless steel case and satin-finished crown. As the several textures and finishes play off one another, the 17.06 comes into its own as a watch that was conceived to make use of light in ways we rarely see in horology.", "Beyond its beautiful design, the 17.06 is technically impressive too. Waterproof to 100m, the Ming is a rather capable dress watch. Powered by the quintessential workhorse movement, the ETA 2824-2, Ming has modified the movement to have two crown positions and regulated it in five positions. As such, the 17.06 is more than adequately equipped to keep time than a lot of other watches that use the very same movement. It is interesting to note that even as an independent watchmaker, Ming still takes the utmost care in ensuring what they produce is of incredible value and can stand up to brands that are priced far beyond what Ming prices their watches at.", "Furthermore, the 17.06 Copper managed to win the Horological Revelation Prize at the GPHG in 2019, a watch industry award that is akin to the Grammys. It was an amazing feat that truly solidified the MING brand as a true success and one that is here to last."], "productCr": "This Ming 17.06 Copper is in excellent condition.

{"productYear": "2000s", "title": "Cartier Tortue Monopoussoir CPCP", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The name Cartier needs no introduction. As one of the most influential and celebrated jewellery and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability. Without taking away from its historical significance, I would say that when it comes to watches, Cartier has always been predominantly known as a \u2018design\u2019 brand rather than a pure watchmaking one, with stunningly iconic models such as the Tank, the Crash and the Santos all seen as important due to how it looks. In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches and with this in mind, Cartier decided that I was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux and more. ", "The easiest way to differentiate a CPCP watch was by the dial, with all but one model (Tank Cintr\u00e9e) featuring a \u2018Cartier Paris\u2019 inscription- an ode to its heritage. The dials were always crafted from solid gold and often featured a strong hand-turned guilloche pattern.", "The CPCP collection ran for 10 years between 1998 and 2008 and I can confidently say it is one of the most significant periods in Cartier\u2019s history. It\u2019s beautiful to see that Cartier was doing \u2018reissues\u2019 before it was even a thing and doing it the right way- respecting the past while producing something that is modern. Not only this, but the CPCP models were produced in truly limited numbers, with many having a designated run of 50 to 100 pieces. For those in the Collection Priv\u00e9 that weren\u2019t strictly \u2018limited\u2019, it is estimated that only 250-300 pieces were made for each reference making any CPCP watch out there truly special.

The truth is, Roger Dubuis, the man, left the company in 2005 and while he was undoubtedly a brilliant watchmaker, he lacked business expertise.", "It is this, and not his watchmaking skills, that caused the brand to be what it is today- devoid of emotion and controlled by business executives with no passion. You see, underneath this sheath of failure lies some of the most beautiful watches ever made. Early Roger Dubuis watches are nothing like what they are today- elegant in their design and finished to the highest standards, these watches rivaled and even bettered contemporaries such as Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet. In fact, collectors have finally started to realize this and as a result, prices have been skyrocketing. ", "An independent brand with aspiration, I have no doubt that today\u2019s indies have Dubuis and other pioneers of his time to thank for laying out the groundwork. Roger Dubuis formed his eponymous brand in 1995 after two decades at Patek Philippe and at the time, it not only took huge courage to start an independent brand but Dubuis had to also operate in an area that wasn\u2019t as mainstream as it is today.", "Constructed of 18kt rose gold, the Sympathies 37mm case is a feast for the eyes. Featuring a vertical satin grain on the caseband and lug profiles with a contrasting high polish on the bezel, thick fixing screws, and lug hoods, the Sympathie is a finely executed timepiece with appreciable attention to detail. Asides from its case, the Sympathies dial also stands out as a unique piece of design. Featuring a tri-tone design, the dial has applied gold Breguet style hour markers and an orange seconds track along its periphery sitting atop a shiny gloss black dial. With rose gold dauphine hands, the dial set up perfectly matches the Sympathies rose gold case, black leather strap, and distinctive rose gold pin buckle. ", "I must say that this is one of the most beautiful dials I\u2019ve seen in a while and when it first came to me I was amazed. The way the light reflects off the dial is reminiscent of vintage gilt gloss dials and the oversized applied Breguet numerals are so distinctive that you can\u2019t help but to keep staring at your wrist. ", "Powered by the automatic Roger Dubuis Cal. RD57, the Sympathie is as elegantly equipped within its case, as it is visually appealing from the outside. On display behind its sapphire crystal caseback, the RD57 is a finely finished piece of horology including black polished screws and swan's neck regulator, gorgeous c\u00f4tes de Geneve motif, and mirrored chamfering throughout.

Famed for working at Patek Philippe as creative director for 40 years and for placing third at the 1979 24 Hour Le Mans race, today he is known for his Haute Horlogerie with his eponymous brand. Making several dozen pieces only a year, to own a Laurent Ferrier is quite a special experience.

Featuring the same impressive movement, the Square came with a brand new cushion style case design that was a bit more unusual. Nevertheless, on the wrist at 40mm, this Gallet Square sits excellently and is just as appropriate as a dress watch as it is for something more casual. This particular example is special as it houses one of the more beautiful dials that Laurent Ferrier produces. It is very hard to photograph or to describe as one must really see it shimmering in the light to appreciate it, but the closest I can get is that it is some sort of a sunburst straw color. With a sub-seconds at 6 o\u2019clock, a ghosted logo subtly placed above and only four long applied hour markers, this particular Galet Square is an exercise in minimalism. Furthermore, this example was custom ordered by the previous owner with additionally applied dots added to each hour to improve legibility. The normal production models do not feature this and I do think it makes it just that bit more special.", "While I can hark on about how beautiful the dial is, it is the movement that really made people fall in love with Laurent Ferrier in the first place. The finishing and architecture of his watches are some of the best in the business and with this example, it is no different. The Cal. 229.01 micro-rotor movement is what made Laurent Ferrier famous when they first launched and to this day, it is still one that I admire. I don\u2019t think I have to explain too much, the photos will do the talking and show how amazing the finishing is.", "Laurent Ferrier makes some of the most beautiful and understated dress watches in the market today, and not many people will know what it is.

{"productYear": "2016", "title": "F.P. Journe Chronometre Bleu", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["Where to begin with F.P. Journe. Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both of who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "Of all the watches F.P. Journe has ever made, none has caught the public attention more than the Chronometre Bleu. While there are certainly more complicated, rare and special timepieces from FPJ, the Chronometre Bleu is the watch that really made the brand into a household name, into the mainstream. Released in 2009, it was made largely as a response to the 2008 crisis that threatened many businesses around the world. In order to stay afloat, the Chronometre Bleu was priced as an entry-level watch to keep sales going.", "There are several things unique about this watch, most significantly, of course, being the fact that it is made completely out of tantalum, a very unusual material for watches. It is a material that is rarer than gold and it is extremely hard to both mine and machine, making it very expensive to produce. The result is a material that has dark blue and silver tones and something you do not see very often. It is a beautiful look that sits stealthily on the wrist and throws off different hues depending on the light source. On top of this, not only is the Chronometre Bleu is the only watch in the F.P. Journe line-up that is made from Tantalum, but also from a 39mm case. ", "Moving on to the dial, it certainly would have to be one of the most impressive dials out there. The chrome blue dial is super reflective and it is achieved through multiple layers of blue lacquer that is hand applied and polished multiple times. It is very well known that the Chronometre Bleu dial is the most complicated and expensive dial that Journe produces with a high failure rate. The result though is a beautifully enigmatic dial that can look from a deep blue/black to a super-light electric blue.", "It is for all of these reasons that F.P. Journe decided to cut production of the Chronometre Bleu. It was just too expensive for an \u2018entry-level\u2019 piece and as a result, demand for this watch has surged even more. I think for once it is nice that the market has priced this higher than retail because collectors recognize that for years Journe was underpricing the Chronometre Bleu. I would say that this could be the most significant \u2018independent\u2019 watch ever produced as it really put the spotlight on artisanal, independent watchmaking. Today it is very normal to collect independents, but before the Chronometre Bleu, that realm was only reserved for the most hardcore of watch collectors."], "productCr": "This F.P.

{"productYear": "2019", "title": "Patek Philippe Annual Calendar 5205R", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["I would first begin by saying that in my opinion, the Patek Philippe 5205 Annual Calendar is perhaps the perfect embodiment of what a modern Patek should be. Sure, it is not the rarest or most complicated watch that the brand makes, but I feel that the sum of its parts, from the dial to the case and movement, really makes this a contender for the definitive Patek Philippe of the 21st century so far.", "Rewinding back slightly, the annual calendar complication was invented and patented by Patek Philippe in 1996 as they realized that there was a gap between a simple calendar watch and the highly complicated perpetual calendar complication. While a simple calendar must be adjusted every month, and a perpetual calendar never needs to be adjusted, even on leap years, an annual calendar sits in the middle, where the user only has to adjust the watch once a year in February, while the mechanism takes care of the 30 and 31 days of the rest of the year. The highly expensive perpetual calendar was too inaccessible and the annual calendar provided the perfect balance between practicality and cost.", "The reason why I think the 5205 is the perfect modern watch is because while it may seem like your average dress watch, the design cues Patek incorporated into the references really makes it one of the most versatile pieces to own. Beginning with the 18k rose gold case, it is sized at a modern 40mm and sits very well on the wrist, giving the right amount of presence without being too large. The case itself has an unusual concave bezel that really draws you into the dial and one of my favorite parts of this watch is the beautiful hollowed-out lugs that flow amorphously through to the center of the case. The holes and indentation to the side of the case really make this watch much \u2018lighter\u2019 in its aesthetic and really provides a much-needed balance. This particular example has the tried and tested black dial and rose gold case combination that just always works. It looks so elegant in this layout and makes for a striking dress watch.

There are reasons for this of course, with questionable watch designs over the years and their dominance in Haute Horlogerie, it was always going to be an uphill battle. That being said, after you\u2019re done reading this, you will see why the Chopard 16/1860/2 is anything of the aforementioned and one of the most revered watches to those who are in the know.", "Beginning with some historical context, the \u201990s was seen as a period of recovery, where watch companies were still wary of the devastating quartz crisis that decimated the industry in the \u201980s and as a result, remained largely conservative. Most houses were content using movements that had existed for decades from suppliers such as Valjoux, Lemania, and ETA. Bar a few outliers, it was just not the time to go wild. ", "Not only was the 1.96 masterfully decorated, but it was also technically a marvel. With a 70-hour power reserve from two stacked mainspring barrels, it also featured a Breguet over-coil hairspring and a swan neck regulator, all contributing towards its precision and power dispersion. The most comparable movement to the 1.96 would have to be the ever-trusty Patek Philippe Caliber 240. While that movement is historically important and impressive nonetheless, when comparing the two side by side, I think there is no contest as to who comes out on top. As a cherry on top, not only is this Chopard COSC certified, but it also bears the hallowed Geneva Seal. ", "Flipping the watch over, there is a strong resemblance to a certain Dufour Simplicity and that is because the 16/1860/2 dial was produced by Metelem, the same Swiss dial manufacturer that produced for the Simplicity. The beautiful hand engine-turned dial is stepped and made of white gold and features a beautiful central guilloche pattern that reflects light beautifully. ", "I really do think that the 16/1860/2 is one of the most underrated and forgotten watches out there, perhaps because from photos it just looks like an ordinary dress watch. It\u2019s perfect 37mm sizing and great proportions really make for an elegant watch, not to mention that only 1680 example was made in yellow gold.

", "The Submariner 116610 was introduced in 2010 and replaced the 16610 which had been in production for nearly 2 decades. This was, a relatively huge change in the Submariner design language with a beefier brand new stainless steel case, maintaining its size at 40mm but with thicker lugs, a new bracelet, and of course, the ceramic \u2018Cerachrom\u2019 bezel. While the classic black Submariner was introduced and somewhat expected, Rolex had a surprise up their sleeves, also introducing an \u2018LV\u2019 version, with a green bezel and dial. Of course, the world went nuts for it and to this day it remains one of the most desirable Rolex models. ", "Quickly nicknamed \u2018The Hulk\u2019 for obvious reasons, it was a direct successor to the previous 16610LV \u2018Kermit\u2019 which featured only a green bezel and a black dial. As it was an anniversary piece, no one expected Rolex to carry on with the green theme. The green certainly adds an edge over the standard black Submariner and allows for some variances in the otherwise sometimes mundane diver line up. ", "On the wrist, the 116610LV has a very muscular presence, with a nice overall heft.

A necessary foundation piece for any Haute Horlogerie brand, the dress watch is a must and with the Calatrava, Patek Philippe continues to build on its rich tradition to this day. ", "For a bit of historical context, we go back to the \u201930s when Charles and Henri Stern purchased the Patek Philippe brand. To revamp the manufacture, the first model they produced is, of course, the Calatrava. The Ref. 96 came in 1932, at a time when wristwatches were beginning to take over pocket watches and it was a move that cemented their status as one of the eminent watch brands of the world. To this day, the Stern family still owns Patek Philippe and you can tell that the Calatrava is still a staple in the brand\u2019s lineup. ", "Since then, there have been many iterations of the classic Calatrava, from varying case sizes to dial styles, with this example being one of my favorites. I am always drawn to the vintage-inspired Calatravas such as this and the 5296G Sector Dial. As a guy who started out with vintage watches, I can immediately recognize the inspiration behind the 5196P- the reference 570. The 570 is considered by many collectors to be the pinnacle of vintage Calatrava, due to its large size and variations in dial style. Of all the 570s, the most desirable ones are those with two-tone dials with Breguet numerals, and it is nice to know that Patek Philippe themselves took notice. The design of the original is almost identical to the 5196P, with a concentrically brushed outer ring, applied Breguet numerals, and a smooth opaline center. ", "The 5196P is the flagship Calatrava and without a doubt the most expensive one that Patek makes. Based on my research, despite being still in production and having been made since 2004, the number of these produced is very low with not many available on the market.

Designed by 22-year-old watch designer, Emmanuel Gueit, the Offshore's raison d'etre was to establish a foothold in the increasingly youth-oriented luxury sports watch market that was opening up. As AP had recognized that younger collectors were beginning to spend more money, they decided they needed a watch to market to these individuals, and the Offshore was that watch.", "While the Royal Oak itself was already classified as a luxury sports watch, it wasn't necessarily a watch you would wear during strenuous activities. Gueit's objective was to create a timepiece that could withstand the youth's active lifestyles and stand up to punishment. To achieve this, the Offshore was given several upgrades compared to its predecessor that, rather ironically, succeeded in garnering the same initially negative reaction from the public as the Royal Oak all those years back.", "These upgrades were primarily functional but succeeded in having a visual impact on the Offshore. To start with, the case was enlarged to 42mm and given crown guards. On top of this, the iconic bracelet found on the Royal Oak was changed ever-so-slightly as the links tapered to ensure a more comfortable fit on the wrist. Also, the waterproof gasket underneath the famous octagonal bezel was enlarged to increase the water-resistance of the Offshore. Finally, looking at the dial of the Offshore, it was fitted with a tachymeter scale along its rehaut and 'Mega Tapisserie' pattern throughout, different to the Royal Oak's 'Grande Tapisserie'.\u00a0", "Offered here, we have a 2019 Bucherer Edition of the Offshore.

Merging a pink gold bezel with a steel case and pink gold links that attach to a rubber strap, this is a gorgeous mix of golden elegance and sporty design. Limited to just 300 pieces, this is an exclusive timepiece that very few will ever get to own. While the Offshore has certainly succeeded in becoming a sporty timepiece, the Bucherer Edition is perhaps a move back towards the original luxury sports watch roots of the Royal Oak.

Known for their tool-watches, it is no surprised that Tudor would use the Black Bay collection to marry 200m dive watch water resistance with both, time only setups and complications like chronographs and GMTs, as we have here. In essence, the Black Bay range can be characterized as a watch that merges everyday function with historical design and watchmaking excellence.", "Taking design inspiration from their sibling brand Rolex, Tudor has adopted a Pepsi-style bezel for their Black Bay GMT but in typical rebellious younger sibling fashion, opted to do it their own way. Deciding to swap the bright blue and vibrant red that was made famous by Rolex' GMT-Master, Tudor has gone with a muted tone of matte burgundy and an equally toned-down shade of matte blue.", "Completing the vintage aesthetic of the Black Bay, the GMT we offer here is mounted to a steel bracelet with faux rivets on the outside of the links.

{"productYear": "1990's", "title": "Daniel Roth Tourbillon C187", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["When we think of the big independents today, names such as Voutilainen, Dufour, Journe, and Smith come to mind. In fact, there is such a huge appreciation for independents today that is has become somewhat mainstream within collecting circles to own at least one watch from an independent brand.", "Before all of this hype though, there was Daniel Roth. To be honest, in my opinion, the story of the Daniel Roth brand is a tragic one that could\u2019ve worked out very differently.", "Daniel Roth the man came from a family of watchmakers and as such, was always destined to be one. Beginning his career at Audemars Piguet in Le Brassus, he worked there for 7 years before moving on to Breguet during the Chaumet era, where he really honed his skills.", "Without a doubt, Daniel Roth is one of the most talented watchmakers of his generation and was responsible for many things you see today but do not realize. At Breguet, he was a leading figure that established the design language of the Breguet dress watches that you see today. In the \u201960s and \u201970s, Breguet had become a below-average watch brand with no future, mainly supplying utilitarian Type 20 watches to the military.", "When they were acquired by the Chaumet brothers, they brought in Daniel Roth to lead the helm as technical director. The reference 3130 for example, with its guilloche dial and its straight lugged case, set the tone for Breguet and was created by Daniel Roth after studying the brand\u2019s history and archives for over a year. Moreover, he played a significant role in producing complicated movements for Lemania who may I remind you up until recently still provided the likes of Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin with chronograph calibers.", "It wasn\u2019t until the Chaumet brothers fell into scandal and had to sell Breguet, that Roth decided to pave his own path forward. Towards the end of the \u201980s, Daniel Roth did the unthinkable by starting his own eponymous \u2018independent\u2019 brand. Back then, it was a crazy thing to do, especially as the industry was still reeling from the quartz crisis that decimated most brands. ", "Without the constraints of big corporate hovering over him, he was free to create whatever he wanted and the results were some of the most original and beautiful watch designs of all time. You see, while no one can question the technical genius of Roth\u2019s watchmaking, what many do not realize is that he is also a master in design, with an innate eye for proportion, texture, and depth. ", "The most unique trait of the Daniel Roth brand is without a doubt the double ellipse case that underpinned the entire collection. It featured a three-piece case that was an amalgamation of a rectangular shape cut off by semi-circles at the top and bottom, resulting in a look that was truly unique. ", "Of all the early models released by Roth, the most iconic is what you see here today, the C187 Tourbillon. While there are uniquely Daniel Roth design cues, you can certainly see how working at Breguet influenced him. This watch features a fantastically elegant 35 X 38mm 18k yellow gold case and houses a beautifully finished one-minute Tourbillon. Attached to the cage are three hands in differing lengths that act as a second counter corresponding to the three-tiered display above the cage. Not only was showing a Tourbillon at the front not done back in the day, but the display of seconds was another original Roth idea. ", "The dial itself is another marvel, made from 18k grey gold with a hand engine-turned vertical ligne guilloch\u00e9 pattern. Atop of this is a satin silver sub-dial with Roman numerals that are knurled around the edges, adding a really nice depth and contrast to the dial. Flipping the watch over, there is a second dial that features all of the aforementioned details, displaying the date and the power reserve.", "Tourbillon watches are more often than not slightly on the crude side and lacking in elegance, but the Daniel Roth C187 is anything but. From the beautifully long black polished Tourbillon bridges to the overall layout and proportion of the watch, it is, in my opinion, a true benchmark of great watch design. Furthermore, everything from the choice of font to the contrasting guilloche patterns really contributes to give the C187 a real \u2018hand-made\u2019 feel.", "There are three distinct stages that define the story of Daniel Roth, beginning with the early period where he was in full control and at the helm. Of course, this period is the most collectible but not only because of its historical importance but also because of the quality of watches that came out was the best. With pieces made only in precious metal, no corners were cut. Later on, after much success, 1995 marked the second chapter of the brand. It is unknown why, but The Hour Glass, one of the biggest watch retailers in the world bought a majority stake in the brand and that is when things started turning sour. While there certainly remain some pieces from that era that are beautiful, the quality began dropping with some questions designs. The whole story cumulates in the final chapter where The Hour Glass was forced to sell Daniel Roth to Bvlgari due to the Asian Financial Crisis, marking the of any involvement by its founder. ", "It is sad that such a beautiful brand ended up this way, but perhaps as the first real independent brand, mistakes were bound to be made. What he did do was pave the way and to show budding watchmakers like Journe and Dubuis what was possible and what to avoid. ", "For many years after that, Daniel Roth watches were placed in one basket and forgotten. Lousy Bvlgari interpretations were classed the same as watches such as the beautiful C187 Tourbillon and priced as such. With the resurgence of independents and 90\u2019s watches in general, I know collectors are starting to realize and as more information comes out, I am confident that early Daniel Roth watches will be restored back to its former glory.

A necessary foundation piece for any Haute Horlogerie brand, the dress watch is a must and with the Calatrava, Patek Philippe continues to build on its rich tradition to this day. ", "For a bit of historical context, we go back to the \u201930s when Charles and Henri Stern purchased the Patek Philippe brand. To revamp the manufacture, the first model they produced is, of course, the Calatrava. The Ref. 96 came in 1932, at a time when wristwatches were beginning to take over pocket watches and it was a move that cemented their status as one of the eminent watch brands of the world. To this day, the Stern family still owns Patek Philippe and you can tell that the Calatrava is still a staple in the brand\u2019s lineup.

I am always drawn to the vintage-inspired Calatravas such as this and the 5296G Sector Dial. As a guy who started out with vintage watches, I can immediately recognize the inspiration behind the 5196P- the reference 570. The 570 is considered by many collectors to be the pinnacle of vintage Calatrava, due to its large size and variations in dial style. Of all the 570s, the most desirable ones are those with two-tone dials with Breguet numerals, and it is nice to know that Patek Philippe themselves took notice. The design of the original is almost identical to the 5196P, with a concentrically brushed outer ring, applied Breguet numerals, and a smooth opaline center.

While many have said that watches are obsolete, the Patek Philippe 5230G is truly one that defies that and possesses real utility.

Moser & Cie is an independent watch brand that has become known as the enfant terrible of the Swiss watchmaking industry. Quite a polarising brand, they made their name initially creating beautiful elegant timepieces but in the last few years, they have really become a force to reckon with introducing satire into their watchmaking, with pieces such as the one-off \u2018Swiss Cheese\u2019 watch and \u2018Apple\u2019 watch. I for one think this is refreshing that a brand is taking an active stand to criticize and create a commentary on the Swiss watch industry, especially as it comes from a brand with a very strong pedigree. ", "While there have been many more complicated timepieces from the brand, for me, the flagship will always be their Perpetual Calendar 1. This was the first watch that Moser released when they relaunched in 2005 and it was disruptive in its own right. It even won the 2006 GPHG award in the complication category. ", "The Moser Perpetual Calendar is truly a lesson in minimalism as perpetual calendars are traditionally trying to cram a lot of information onto a small dial. What Moser did was distill down all of the most important information, making it intuitive and the result is a watch that could be mistaken for a time and date only watch from far. So as we all know, a perpetual calendar watch is able to distinguish the number of days in every month, including during leap years so you need to be able to see the day, month, and which year it is in the leap year cycle. The most obvious is the large date aperture at 3 o\u2019clock, but if you look closely, there\u2019s a small arrow hand and that is the month indicator. 12 hours in a day, 12 months in a year with 1 being January and 12 being December. Furthermore, Moser realized that knowing the leap year is not as important so they placed it behind on the movement side, which actually makes a lot of sense. How often do we check whether it\u2019s a leap year or not? When this came out, it really made people rethink what a perpetual calendar should look like. ", "Moving on to the 40.8mm case, it wears excellently on the wrist and this is partly due to the fact it has a curved sapphire case back. This of course helps with wearability and with the different brushed and polished finishing, I\u2019d have to say that this is one of the more thought out cases in the industry. On the surface, it looks like your average round watch case, but there\u2019s so much more going on.", "The in-house caliber HMC 341 is really a beautiful looking movement.

{"productYear": "2009", "title": "Cartier Tank CPCP Dual Time 2917", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The name Cartier needs no introduction. As one of the most influential and celebrated jewelry and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability. Without taking away from its historical significance, I would say that when it comes to watches, Cartier has always been predominantly known as a \u2018design\u2019 brand rather than a pure watchmaking one, with stunningly iconic models such as the Tank, the Crash, and the Santos- all seen as important due to how it looks. In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches, and with this in mind, Cartier decided that I was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux, and more. ", "The easiest way to differentiate a CPCP watch was by the dial, with all but one model (Tank Cintr\u00e9e) featuring a \u2018Cartier Paris\u2019 inscription- an ode to its heritage. The dials were always crafted from solid gold and often featured a strong hand-turned guilloche pattern with Cartier\u2019s signature \u2018rosette\u2019 in the middle of the dial beneath the handset. ", "The example you see here today is an extremely rare Tank Two Time Zone Ref. 2917. It is a manually wound timepiece with a Piaget derived movement and features one of the more unusual layouts for a watch. With two clocks stacked together, the first position of the crown allows the user to independently jump the hour hand of the bottom clock, while the second position forwards the two clocks simultaneously. This is one of the easiest dual time watches as setting your local time only takes a few seconds. The 18k solid gold dial is classically Cartier with a beautiful guilloche pattern and not one but, two rosettes in underneath each handset! ", "The Tank is one of the most important watches in Cartier\u2019s lineup and is named as such because, well, it looks like a tank from above. It was created in 1917 during World War I and the name was inspired by the new Renault tanks at the time. Since then, there have been countless iterations of the Tank, from sizes and complications, with the 2917 being one of the more unique ones. Whatever it may be though, the Tank will always be known as a both a beautifully elegant and timeless watch and a piece of design that is historically important.", "The CPCP collection ran for 10 years between 1998 and 2008 and I can confidently say it is one of the most significant periods in Cartier\u2019s history. It\u2019s beautiful to see that Cartier was doing \u2018reissues\u2019 before it was even a thing and doing it the right way- respecting the past while producing something that is modern. Not only this, but the CPCP models were produced in truly limited numbers, with many having a designated run of 50 to 100 pieces. For those in the Collection Priv\u00e9 that weren\u2019t strictly \u2018limited\u2019, it is estimated that only 250-300 pieces were made for each reference making any CPCP watch out there truly special. ", "Collectors are finally taking notice of this, and Cartier in general as a brand worth collecting. With more knowledge available now, the demand for Cartier has been huge and I only see it getting larger, especially for important references such as those from the CPCP line.

", "The public was shocked because it was such a radical move for Patek Philippe to release a sports watch (outside of the Nautilus and Aquanaut line) in steel! The reviews were mixed and it has been known for a while that the brand has been trying to attract a younger audience, with the 5960A being testament to that. What is even more unusual is the decision to discontinue this reference just four short years later. No one knows exactly why, but there were rumors that Patek did not want to use steel outside of its Nautilus and Aquanaut range.

{"productYear": "1990's", "title": "Daniel Roth GMT Salmon", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["When we think of the big independents today, names such as Voutilainen, Dufour, Journe, and Smith come to mind. In fact, there is such a huge appreciation for independents today that it has become somewhat mainstream within collecting circles to own at least one watch from an independent brand. ", "Before all of this hype though, there was Daniel Roth. To be honest, in my opinion, the story of the Daniel Roth brand is a tragic one that could\u2019ve worked out very differently. ", "To add some context, Daniel Roth was one of the most talented watchmakers of his generation and was responsible for many things you see today but do not realize. For one, he was a leading figure that established the design language of Breguet dress watches that you see today. In the \u201960s and \u201970s, Breguet had become a below-average watch brand with no future, until they were acquired by Chaumet, who in turn brought in Daniel Roth to lead the helm. The reference 3130, with its guilloche dial and its straight lugged case, set the tone for Breguet and was created by Daniel Roth. Moreover, he played a significant role in producing complicated movements for Lemania who may I remind you up until recently still provided the likes of Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin with chronograph calibers. ", "After that chapter of Roth\u2019s life and entering into the \u201990s, the independent brand \u2018Daniel Roth\u2019 began taking form. There are three distinct periods in the Daniel Roth brand, the early period when he was truly independent, the middle period when The Hour Glass was a stakeholder, and the final period when Bvlgari took over and Daniel Roth left the company.", "In 1995, Daniel Roth joined forces with The Hour Glass Group and the example you see here today is part of that period. With a stunning salmon dial and an ingenious GMT function, it is a fantastic dress watch with huge value. The aperture at 12 o\u2019clock displays the second time zone hour and the bottom aperture acts as a 24 hour indicator. All of this is adjustable via the first position of the crown, making it extremely easy to use.", "Looking closer, you will see the beautiful attention to detail on the watch, with a vertical guilloche dial reminiscent of his days in Breguet and a beautifully symmetrical design layout.", "I truly think that these Daniel Roth watches are hugely under-appreciated and it is a tragedy that the man himself does not get the recognition he deserves. Due to bad business decisions, several takeovers, and just pure bad luck, the brand Daniel Roth eventually ended up with Bvlgari, who today absorbed his distinctive case shape and branded it under their own. Compared to the original Roth pieces, which were elegant, understated, and beautiful, today\u2019s reiteration by Bvlgari is a far cry from that- oversized and gaudy. It does make me sad to see such a great watch brand tarnished, but I am sure it will be a matter of time before his great work is appreciated again."], "productCr": "This Daniel Roth Salmon Dial GMT is in excellent condition.
