Known famously by its ethos of collaborating and acknowledging other master watchmakers in the industry, it is helmed by Max Busser who together has created some of the most radical and out-there watch designs. ", "The LM101, as denoted, is part of the Legacy Machine series and is the most wearable MB&F by a long margin. Sized at 40mm, it is sized more conservatively than the other 44mm LM\u2019s and for me, sits the best on the wrist. While the LM101 is considered the entry-level MB&F, it is my favorite because of its balance between being simple yet looking crazy at the same time.", "This particular example is the LM101 \u2018Frost\u2019 and was a limited edition produced by the brand in 2015. They made 18 examples of these in yellow gold, making it incredibly rare and a true \u2018limited\u2019 edition. As the name denotes, the technique of frosting takes center stage. Developed by Abraham-Louis Breguet in the late 18th and 19th centuries, it is a method that was widely used as a finishing technique for pocket watches. While today most watches are finished with your typical Geneva stripes, it is very nice to see an alternative on wristwatches. ", "The dial of this LM101 is beautifully hand-frosted and the way it shimmers and reflects light is really amazing. The dial can look very dark in certain lighting and complete explode with flecks of yellow speckles when the sun shines down. Of course, while its all about the frosting technique, we cannot forget the MB&F signature that made it so famous in the first place- the huge 14mm floating balance on the front of the watch. With a v-shaped 3D bridge suspending the balance on top of the dial, this is anything but a \u2018classical\u2019 watch and I guarantee you will find yourself staring at this watch all day long. A power reserve land time indication lacquered sub dial floats above the frosted dial as well and finishes off the 3D masterpiece.", "Flip the watch over and you will see that MB&F didn\u2019t stop at the dial. The entire movement is frosted and in yellow gold as well. The overall aesthetic design of the movement is so beautiful, with huge spaces between the bridges and large blued screws contrasting with the frosted gold. Interestingly, the LM101 movement is the first entirely developed and assembled in-house movement from the brand, with help of course form a long time friend of the house, Kari Voutilainen.", "With only 18 pieces produced of this MB&F LM101 \u2018Frost\u2019 in yellow gold, this is a truly rare and special watch that you will not see very often."], "productCr": "This MB&F LM101 Frost is in mint condition.

{"productYear": "2019", "title": "A. Lange & Sohne Datograph Perpetual Grey", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["When thinking of the real heavyweights in Haute Horlogerie, only a few big names come to mind- Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin, Audemars Piguet, and of course, the Germans next door, A. Lange & Sohne. While many see Swiss watches as the pinnacle of watchmaking, Lange serves as a reminder that this isn\u2019t the case. In fact, one can say that in some areas, Lange is considered much better than its Swiss counterparts. ", "Everything said in the introduction predominantly revolves around one aspect of watchmaking- the chronograph. A. Lange & Sohne today is seen as the undisputed king of chronographs and there is a good reason why- the in-house Datograph. ", "First introduced in 1999, it sent shockwaves through the watch industry as creating an in-house chronograph was no easy feat, let alone for some young German brand. Remember, this was a time when houses like Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin were still using Lemania movements for their chronographs, and Lange wasn\u2019t even a decade old. ", "The Datograph was a very traditional, super high-end, manually wound chronograph made in Germany and not only was it a technical marvel, but it was finished to the highest standards and looked beautiful too. Imagine how the Swiss felt when this happened! Architecturally, the Datograph movement had an amazing three-dimensional look to it, with an intricately engraved balance cock and bridges and plates made out of German silver. The finishing was the best in the industry and there was just this warm glow to the movement from the German Silver that Swiss movements just didn\u2019t have.", "It wasn\u2019t until 2010 that Patek caught up and released their own in-house manually wound chronograph and it took another 5 years after that for Vacheron to catch up.", "Since then, there have been variations of Lange\u2019s chronograph movement and this is one of them. The Datograph Perpetual was first released in 2006 and was a natural progression after the standard Datograph. The perpetual calendar chronograph has always been seen as a flagship complication for any brand and it was imperative that Lange did so too. ", "With a 41mm 18k white gold case, the comparisons to the Patek Philippe 5270 was always inevitable and largely seen as a big rivalry between two of the biggest watch manufactures. With it\u2019s iconic jumping big date at 12 o\u2019clock though, it is unmistakably a Lange. ", "It goes without saying that the L952.1 caliber is a sight to behold and even people who don\u2019t know about watches can tell just how good it is. Just like every perpetual calendar chronograph watch, this Datograph Perpetual uses a calendar module fitted atop the chronograph watch to complete the complication. The movement is incredibly hand finished with thick bevelling and deep Glash\u00fctte ribbing on every surface. ", "The Datograph Perpetual has always been very conservative in its design, being made only with a white dial in either a white gold or rose gold case but in 2018 they released this example- fitted with a beautiful grey dial. The grey is quite enigmatic and ethereal in its nature as it varies in tone depending on the light source. While blue dials are all the rage these days I was very happy to see Lange buck the trend with this fantastic grey dial. ", "Despite the huge rivalry between the other Swiss brands, there is no doubt that A. Lange & Sohne is at the top of its game, with this Datograph Perpetual as one of its flagships. Even the legend Philippe Dufour himself owns a Datograph and routinely cites Lange as the best in terms of movement finishing in mainstream watchmaking. "], "productCr": "This A.

In fact, there is such a huge appreciation for independents today that is has become somewhat mainstream within collecting circles to own at least one watch from an independent brand. ", "Before all of this hype though, there was Daniel Roth. To be honest, in my opinion, the story of the Daniel Roth brand is a tragic one that could\u2019ve worked out very differently. ", "To add some context, Daniel Roth was one of the most talented watchmakers of his generation and was responsible for many things you see today but do not realise. For one, he was a leading figure that established the design language of Breguet dress watches that you see today. In the \u201960s and \u201970s, Breguet had become a below-average watch brand with no future, until they were acquired by Chaumet, who in turn brought in Daniel Roth to lead the helm. The reference 3130, with its guilloche dial and its straight lugged case, set the tone for Breguet and was created by Daniel Roth. Moreover, he played a significant role in producing complicated movements for Lemania who may I remind you up until recently still provided the likes of Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin with chronograph calibres. ", "After that chapter of Roth\u2019s life and entering into the \u201990s, the independent brand \u2018Daniel Roth\u2019 began taking form and the watch you see here today is the pinnacle of it. This Daniel Roth Papillon was made as a 10-year anniversary celebration of the brand and it features a jumping hour complication and his distinctive tonneau-shaped case. Looking closer, you will see the beautiful attention to detail on the watch, with a guilloche dial reminiscent of his days in Breguet and a beautiful symmetrical design layout. The 12 o\u2019clock aperture shows the jumping hour while the bottom half of the dial tells the minute with an oversized blued pointer. In the middle of the dial and layered above the hour and minute lies a beautiful running seconds subdial with a different guilloche pattern and a large blued seconds hand. The depth of the dial achieved through the layering and different guilloche patterns is really stunning. Flip the watch over and you will see his signature guilloched solid gold rotor and his calibre finished to perfection. ", "I truly think that these Daniel Roth watches are hugely under-appreciated and it is a tragedy that the man himself does not get the recognition he deserves. Due to bad business decisions, several takeovers and just pure bad luck, the brand Daniel Roth eventually ended up with Bvlgari, who today absorbed his distinctive case shape and branded it under their own. Compared to the original Roth pieces, which were elegant, understated and beautiful, today\u2019s reiteration by Bvlgari is a far cry from that- oversized and gaudy. It does make me sad to see such a great watch brand tarnished, but I am sure it will be a matter of time before his great work is appreciated again.

At the center of the hype is the watch you see here today- the Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 in stainless steel with a blue dial. ", "First released in the 1970s the Nautilus, designed by none other than Gerald Genta himself, was a crazy, avant-garde sports watch in stainless steel that sold for an eye-watering price. While the Royal Oak was designed in this same sense, Audemars Piguet was largely seen as the bad boys of the industry and when Patek Philippe followed suit, clients and critics alike who were used to seeing elegant dress watches were shocked to see that they followed in the footsteps AP. This was further reinforced by the fact that both were designed by the same man! The reference 3700 \u2018Jumbo\u2019, the first Nautilus model ever made, of course as we know managed to defy the odds and today is one of the holy grails of vintage Patek Philippe. ", "Fast forward to 2006, and Patek Philippe releases the heir apparent to the 3700 \u2018Jumbo\u2019, the 5711. Featuring an ultra-slim 8.3mm case, it is so thin not only for a sports watch but in general, sliding easily under the cuff of a shirt. The dial, offered in blue and white came with the familiar ridged dial and integrated stainless steel bracelet. For a while, you could\u2019ve bought these at the boutique at retail but in the last few years, it is practically close to impossible to buy any Nautilus, let alone this 5711. While on paper the 5711 sits as the cheapest Nautilus you can buy, it is the hardest one to get as this is the reference collectors want the most. With this example, you get a stunning blue dial that throws off shades of green, black and blue depending on the light source and a beautifully finished case, with beautifully polished beveled edges contrasting with the brushed overall finish.", "The Patek Philippe Nautilus is really the ultimate luxury sports watch, combining brutalist design elements with an elegant profile and sizing. It is just such a cool watch and with the 5711 in particular, it is as pure as it gets, remaining faithful to the original Genta-designed 3700 \u2018Jumbo\u2019 from 40 years ago.

{"productYear": "2013", "title": "F.P. Journe Chronometre A Resonance Black Label", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["Where to begin with F.P. Journe. Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "With the Resonance, one really has to begin with the movement and the whole concept behind the watch. Powered by the in-house Calibre 1499.2, the idea of resonance was something that intrigued Francois-Paul Journe for a long time. Failing to create a successful movement that incorporated resonance in the \u201980s, it took nearly two decades for Journe to finally be happy with a finished product and that very product is the watch you see here today. In fact, the Chronometre a Resonance has been in production since the Year 2000, and this year (2019) marks the final year for this calibre. ", "Briefly explaining, mechanical resonance is a physical principle where two oscillating balance wheels in a single movement sync up, improving stability and timekeeping via energy transference through vibrating sound waves from the wheels in motion. Though this might sound very complicated, it is a very romantic idea and something that certainly appeals to watch collectors. It is for this very reason that the F.P. Journe Resonance has become the most iconic wristwatch from the man himself.", "What distinguishes this piece from your regular Journe is of course in the name, all Black Label pieces take on a monochromatic colour palette. Beginning with a 40mm platinum case, it is interesting to note that Journe only uses platinum for his precious white metal watches, so you won\u2019t find any in white gold. The main differentiating factor of this edition is the deep black glossy dial. Two clocks are displayed on the dial, with the left side hidden in a rotating aperture and the right one displaying the more traditional F.P. Journe layout. A crown at 4 o\u2019clock acts as a resetting tool for the two sub-seconds, where pulling it out resets and hacks the seconds and syncs them in the process while the crown at 12 o\u2019clock is used for setting the time and winding the watch. ", "F.P. Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic. Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through. ", "The purists really love Journe because of his motto \u2018Invenit et Fecit\u2019, which translates from Latin to Invent and Create. To this day, F.P. Journe has stuck to this mantra, where he continues to invent his own in-house movements. Furthremore, everything else is also in-house, even to the point of owning his own case-maker and dial-maker. For a small brand that makes less than 1000 pieces a year, it is really impressive."], "productCr": "This F.P.

{"productYear": "2000", "title": "Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 25820SP Perpetual Calendar", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The Royal Oak, with its masculine octagonal case, exposed screws and integrated bracelet is one of the most distinctive watches in the market today. It is imposing and recognisable, and in my opinion, one of the best statement watches money can buy. ", "The Royal Oak is not only famous for what it looks like, but also how it was introduced. First released in the \u201970s, the original Ref. 5402 was a bold stainless steel watch designed by Gerald Genta that created shockwaves. It was designed as a luxury sport watch and the scandalous part was that it was priced accordingly- the same as an equivalent gold watch of its era. ", "People just could not accept that a pedestrian material such as steel could be priced so exorbitantly and consequently, it was not very popular. It was only after some time that the public saw this as something genuinely original and avant-garde. Today, Audemars Piguet has not only expanded the Royal Oak line to include other materials, but has managed to make this model their flagship and an icon.", "Of late, while the Royal Oak itself has been immensely in demand, the discontinued perpetual calendars have been right at the top of it. This example is a special reference, as denoted by the \u2018SP\u2019 ending, meaning that it is made of both stainless steel and platinum. The shiny, polished finish is platinum while the brushed surfaces are steel. I have handled a fair few perpetual calendar Royal Oaks and I must say that the inclusion of platinum really adds some nice weight and heft to it. ", "Furthermore, the high polish finish of the platinum bezel and center links really stands out and has a huge presence on the wrist. While it is quite unusual for these two materials to be used on the same watch, it seems that this trait is somewhat of a Royal Oak thing, as AP still does this today on the newer 15202IP. ", "With a 39mm case, it sits much better on the wrist than the newer 41mms, with not only better proportions but also being more faithful to the original. In fact, the movement inside this watch is the same you will find on the Jumbo models as it is the legendary JLC Cal. 2120 with a perpetual calendar module built on top. As a result, this watch shares the same thickness as the 15202 with a slightly thicker bezel to accommodate the perpetual calendar module. For such a complicated watch that takes into account how many days each month has, including leap years, this is truly impressive. ", "Part of the reason why there is a renewed interest in perpetual calendar Royal Oaks is because AP themselves have been releasing many of their iconic new models with this collection, from the black and white ceramic models, including the most recent open-worked version, and of course the insane RD2 ultra, ultra-thin. With all of this hype, collectors have begun to realize just how special the early perpetual calendars are and how rare they are, with extremely low production numbers."], "productCr": "This Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar 25820SP is in excellent condition.

All parts are original and nothing has been changed, including the correct unsigned AP crown. The case is unpolished and sharp and has some minor hairlines from use over time.

Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "It goes without saying that F.P. Journe has been one of the hottest brands in the last 12 months, finally gaining the recognition that it deserved all along. With early brass movement pieces hitting records at auction, the rest of the collection has followed. This particular example is one of the more desirable models as it is a discontinued 38mm version. Collectors value the old 38mm sizing due to its perfect proportions and how well it sits on the wrist. Furthermore, this one comes with the elusive and desirable salmon dial. This is one of those watches where photos really do not do the watch justice- in real life, the dial pops and the subtle grained texture of the salmon dial really comes to life.", "Flip the watch over and you will see the in-house FPJ calibre 1300.3 made entirely of rose gold. It has a beautiful 22k gold rotor and all parts are hand finished to perfection. It has a 120-hour power reserve, and this is indicated on the dial.", "The Octa Lune regardless of which variant is one of the all-time greats from the F.P.

One of the early pioneers of the independent movement, Vianney Halter existed before collecting independents a trend. Small scale and taking his time, he has become known today for his distinctive aesthetic. ", "This is the Vianney Halter Classic, one of his most iconic, next to the more complicated Antiqua. A time-only piece, it is housed in a 36mm 18k yellow gold case and features real rivets on the edge of the case along with a studded crown. Two nibs on the top and bottom of the case connect the lugs which hold the strap, rounding off this undoubtedly steampunk style watch. The case is finished with a circular brushing at the top and polished sides, adding a nice depth to the overall look. Wearing and winding the watch, I found it to be a very pleasant tactile experience, from the grip of the studded crown and touching\u00a0the different surfaces of the watch.

Sure, it is not the rarest or most complicated watch that the brand makes, but I feel that the sum of its parts, from the dial to the case and movement, really makes this a contender for the definitive Patek Philippe of the 21st century so far.", "Introduced in 2010, the 5205 marked a new generation of Annual Calendars from Patek Philippe and featured a distinctive 3 aperture layout at 10, 12 and 2 o\u2019clock that displayed the day, date, and month respectively. This was an aesthetic that was truly something new and it is no surprise that this became one of the brand\u2019s best sellers. ", "Rewinding back slightly, the annual calendar complication was invented and patented by Patek Philippe in 1996 as they realized that there was a gap between a simple calendar watch and the highly complicated perpetual calendar complication. While a simple calendar must be adjusted every month, and a perpetual calendar never needs to be adjusted, even on leap years, an annual calendar sits in the middle, where the user only has to adjust the watch once a year in February, while the mechanism takes care of the 30 and 31 days of the rest of the year. The highly expensive perpetual calendar was too inaccessible and the annual calendar provided the perfect balance between practicality and cost.", "The reason why I think the 5205 is the perfect modern watch is that while it may seem like your average dress watch, the design cues Patek incorporated into the references really makes it one of the most versatile pieces to own. Beginning with the 18k rose gold case, it is sized at a modern 40mm and sits very well on the wrist, giving the right amount of presence without being too large. The case itself has an unusual concave bezel which really draws you into the dial and one of my favourite parts of this watch is the beautiful hollowed-out lugs that flow amorphously through to the centre of the case. The holes and indentation to the side of the case really make this watch much \u2018lighter\u2019 in its aesthetic and really provides a much-needed balance.

{"productYear": "2000s", "title": "Cartier Tortue Monopoussoir CPCP", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The name Cartier needs no introduction. As one of the most influential and celebrated jewellery and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability. Without taking away from its historical significance, I would say that when it comes to watches, Cartier has always been predominantly known as a \u2018design\u2019 brand rather than a pure watchmaking one, with stunningly iconic models such as the Tank, the Crash and the Santos all seen as important due to how it looks. In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches and with this in mind, Cartier decided that I was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux and more. ", "The CPCP collection ran for 10 years between 1998 and 2008 and I can confidently say it is one of the most significant periods in Cartier\u2019s history. It\u2019s beautiful to see that Cartier was doing \u2018reissues\u2019 before it was even a thing and doing it the right way- respecting the past while producing something that is modern. Not only this, but the CPCP models were produced in truly limited numbers, with many having a designated run of 50 to 100 pieces. For those in the Collection Priv\u00e9 that weren\u2019t strictly \u2018limited\u2019, it is estimated that only 250-300 pieces were made for each reference making any CPCP watch out there truly special.

Easy and quick to use, it is exactly what a travel watch should be.", "Sized in a 38mm Grade-2 Titanium case, this design has now become the signature look of MING. With flared lugs and a curved bar strap, the completely brushed case really combines with the black of the dial to create a beautifully stealthy and easy to wear watch.

{"productYear": "Circa 2000's", "title": "F.P. Journe Chronometre A Resonance", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["Where to begin with F.P. Journe. Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "Briefly explaining, mechanical resonance is a physical principle where two oscillating balance wheels in a single movement sync up, improving stability and timekeeping via energy transference through vibrating sound waves from the wheels in motion. Though this might sound very complicated, it is a very romantic idea and something that certainly appeals to watch collectors. It is for this very reason that the F.P. Journe Resonance has become the most iconic wristwatch from the man himself.", "The example you see here today features the old Resonance aesthetic, with two symmetrical sub-dials displaying the two different clocks. A crown at 4 o\u2019clock acts as a resetting tool for the two sub-seconds dial, where pulling it out resets and hacks the seconds and syncs them in the process while the crown at 12 o\u2019clock is used for setting the time and winding the watch. For something so complicated, it is actually surprisingly easy to use.", "It has to be mentioned that the Resonance is perhaps one of the most desired Journe pieces, confirmed later in 2019 when an early brass movement example went for 250,000 USD. I\u2019m really glad to finally see Journe receive the recognition he deserves. ", "F.P. Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic. Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through. ", "The purists really love Journe because of his motto \u2018Invenit et Fecit\u2019, which translates from Latin to Invent and Create. To this day, F.P. Journe has stuck to this mantra, where he continues to invent his own in-house movements. Furthermore, everything else is also in-house, even to the point of owning his own case-maker and dial-maker. For a small brand that makes less than 1000 pieces a year, it is really impressive."], "productCr": "This F.P. Journe Chronometre a Resonance is in excellent condition.

Sized at 39mm and using the same JLC derived Cal. 2121 as the original, this is the Royal Oak for the purists.

As a result, there is a huge premium on the used market for examples like this. ", "I must say, I get why people are so in love with the blue Jumbo.

{"productYear": "1999", "title": "Cartier Tank Americaine CPCP", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The name Cartier needs no introduction. As one of the most influential and celebrated jewellery and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability. Without taking away from its historical significance, I would say that when it comes to watches, Cartier has always been predominantly known as a \u2018design\u2019 brand rather than a pure watchmaking one, with stunningly iconic models such as the Tank, the Crash, and the Santos all seen as important due to how it looks. In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches, and with this in mind, Cartier decided that it was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux, and more. ", "The easiest way to differentiate a CPCP watch was by the dial, with all but one model (Tank Cintr\u00e9e) featuring a \u2018Cartier Paris\u2019 inscription- an ode to its heritage. The dials were always crafted from solid gold and often featured a strong hand-turned guilloche pattern.", "While many of Cartier\u2019s design dates back to the early 20th century, the Tank Americaine is a relatively new creation. Released in 1989 and intended to be a more accessible and masculine version of the flagship Tank Cintree, it was released as a normal and unspectacular quartz watch. The dimensions of the Tank Americaine were enlarged, swapping the Cintree\u2019s elongated case for a thicker and wider watch with more presence. ", "Released in 1998 and part of the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris (CPCP), this example is not only rare but powered by a high quality 430 MC manually wound caliber and features a beautiful guilloch\u00e9 dial that CPCP watches have become known for. The prominent rosette in the middle of the dial is a beautiful touch and the more wearable 45X26mm dimensions work fantastically on the wrist.", "Collectors are finally taking notice of this, and Cartier in general is a brand worth collecting. With more knowledge available now, the demand for Cartier has been huge and I only see it getting larger, especially for important references such as those from the CPCP line.

", "For a bit of historical context, we go back to the \u201930s when Charles and Henri Stern purchased the Patek Philippe brand. To revamp the manufacture, the first model they produce is, of course, the Calatrava. The Ref. 96 came in 1932, at a time when wristwatches were beginning to take over pocket watches and it was a move that cemented their status as one of the eminent watch brands of the world. To this day, the Stern family still owns Patek Philippe and you can tell that the Calatrava and in particular this first reference, is very important to them. ", "In the 1980s, under the helm of Philippe Stern, the brand introduces the Ref. 3796, which is what you see here today. What many do not realise, is that the Ref. 3796 is nearly a one to one recreation of the original Calatrava. From its case size to its coin-edged bezel, it wears exactly the same. ", "I see it as a tribute and a nod to the family heritage of both Patek and the Sterns and a historically important reference. This example is made particularly special as although today white metal Patek\u2019s are fairly common, back then they were made in much lower quantities and as a result commands a premium for its rarity. ", "Many see the Calatrava as the blueprint for the ultimate dress watch, and I can\u2019t help but agree.

Journe has only been around for the length of time that it has. Founded in 1999, F.P. Journe burst onto the watchmaking scene with a 20 piece limited run of Tourbillon Souverain Souscription watches that cash-strapped Francois Paul used to finance his brand, just like Abraham Louis Breguet did over 200 years ago. 20 odd years later, however, the F.P. Journe brand has become a horological powerhouse with waiting lists growing ever-longer and auction results growing ever more impressive.", "Here, I have an early 38mm yellow gold F.P Journe Chronom\u00e8tre Souverain offered in spectacular condition. Introduced in 2005, the Souverain impressively won that year\u2019s \u2018Favourite Men\u2019s Watch\u2019 award at the GPHG. Quintessentially Journe-like, the Souverain has become the bedrock from which all other Journe models are built.", "One of the most incredible aspects of this Chronom\u00e8tre Souverain is without a doubt its white dial. Featuring a hobnail,\u00a0Clous de Paris\u00a0pattern in its center, the dial plays with light in a gorgeously enticing way. Framing the dial is a black seconds track along its periphery that, in conjunction with the black Breguet numerals, contrasts the blued steel hands nicely. Thanks to a sub-seconds dial found between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock and a 56-hour power-reserve indicator at 3 o'clock, the Souverain has a highly-legible asymmetrical dial which combines utilitarianism with the aesthetical Journe design choices for which the brand is now famed.", "Aside from the dial, the Chronom\u00e8tre Souverain also has another trick up its sleeve. On display through the sapphire crystal caseback is the impressive in-house\u00a0cal. 1304. Made entirely of 18k rose gold, the cal. 1304 has two mainspring barrels that work in parallel to power the movement over the course of its 56-hour power reserve. Gorgeously constructed and in plain sight thanks to it being manually wound, the cal. 1304 presents the same visual delight from the rear of the Souverain as the dial does from the front.", "What makes this particular example even more special is the fact that it comes sized at 38mm. While today\u2019s Journes are all 40mm or 42mm, early F.P. Journes were sized at 38mm and have now been long discontinued.

{"productYear": "2010", "title": "Cartier Tank CPCP Dual Time 2917", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["The name Cartier needs no introduction. As one of the most influential and celebrated jewelry and watch brands of the last 100 years, it has always stood as a mark of luxury and desirability. Without taking away from its historical significance, I would say that when it comes to watches, Cartier has always been predominantly known as a \u2018design\u2019 brand rather than a pure watchmaking one, with stunningly iconic models such as the Tank, the Crash, and the Santos- all seen as important due to how it looks. In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches, and with this in mind, Cartier decided that it was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux, and more. ", "The easiest way to differentiate a CPCP watch was by the dial, with all but one model (Tank Cintr\u00e9e) featuring a \u2018Cartier Paris\u2019 inscription- an ode to its heritage. The dials were always crafted from solid gold and often featured a strong hand-turned guilloche pattern with Cartier\u2019s signature \u2018rosette\u2019 in the middle of the dial beneath the handset. ", "The example you see here today is an extremely rare Tank Two Time Zone Ref. 2917. It is a manually wound timepiece with a Piaget derived movement and features one of the more unusual layouts for a watch. With two clocks stacked together, the first position of the crown allows the user to independently jump the hour hand of the bottom clock, while the second position forwards the two clocks simultaneously. This is one of the easiest dual time watches as setting your local time only takes a few seconds. The 18k solid gold dial is classically Cartier with a beautiful guilloche pattern and not one but, two rosettes in underneath each handset! ", "The Tank is one of the most important watches in Cartier\u2019s lineup and is named as such because, well, it looks like a tank from above. It was created in 1917 during World War I and the name was inspired by the new Renault tanks at the time. Since then, there have been countless iterations of the Tank, from sizes and complications, with the 2917 being one of the more unique ones. Whatever it may be though, the Tank will always be known as both a beautifully elegant and timeless watch and a piece of design that is historically important.", "The CPCP collection ran for 10 years between 1998 and 2008 and I can confidently say it is one of the most significant periods in Cartier\u2019s history. It\u2019s beautiful to see that Cartier was doing \u2018reissues\u2019 before it was even a thing and doing it the right way- respecting the past while producing something that is modern. Not only this, but the CPCP models were produced in truly limited numbers, with many having a designated run of 50 to 100 pieces. For those in the Collection Priv\u00e9 that weren\u2019t strictly \u2018limited\u2019, it is estimated that only 250-300 pieces were made for each reference making any CPCP watch out there truly special. ", "Collectors are finally taking notice of this, and Cartier in general as a brand worth collecting. With more knowledge available now, the demand for Cartier has been huge and I only see it getting larger, especially for important references such as those from the CPCP line.

{"productYear": "2017", "title": "F.P. Journe Centigraphe Souverain", "productPrice": null, "productDescription": ["Where to begin with F.P. Journe. Started by the man himself in 1999, Journe had previously spent quite a few years restoring and producing movements and also made a couple of pocket watches during that time. It took quite a few years before his brand went from something only a hardcore collector could appreciate to being appreciated by a more mainstream audience and today, he is considered by many as one of the most successful and important independent brands to have emerged.", "In my opinion, F.P. Journe has hit the sweet spot, producing around 900 pieces a year only. This ensures that they are exclusive enough that people consider any Journe a rare piece, but not so rare that it becomes esoteric. There are brands like Roger Smith and Philippe Dufour, both of who are considered godfathers of high horology, but they make so few pieces a year that the average watch collector would not know about them. Mention F.P. Journe though, and you\u2019ll have collectors jumping with joy. ", "What you see here today is one of Journe\u2019s most iconic models- the Centigraphe. Designed to time 1/100th of a second, you can already imagine how complicated this is going to get. There are pushers on the top right-hand side of the case to activate the chronograph, prompting the 10 o\u2019clock sub-dial to start running. Watching this is something very special as you see the foudroyant (flying seconds) run and when you stop the chronograph it can stop anywhere on the sub-dial, allowing the user to record exactly to 1/100th of a second. The other two sub-dials act as a 20 second and 10 minute counter.", "Housed in a 40mm platinum case, there is definitely a nice heft to the watch. I think one of the main reasons why collectors love Journe is because of his signature case. It sits so thin and flat on the wrist and finishes off with lugs that step down and hugs your wrist. Once you strap it on, you\u2019ll understand.", "F.P. Journe has carved a very interesting niche in the independent watch world where he has managed to blend traditional watchmaking and design cues with modern technology and an unmistakably Journe aesthetic. Despite using very traditional elements like his serif\u2019d Arabic numerals, a knurled winding crown and a standard round case, the way it has been laid out combines to create a look that is F.P. Journe through and through. ", "The purists really love Journe because of his motto \u2018Invenit et Fecit\u2019, which translates from Latin to Invent and Create. To this day, F.P. Journe has stuck to this mantra, where he continues to invent his own in-house movements. Furthermore, everything else is also in-house, even to the point of owning his own case-maker and dial-maker. For a small brand that makes less than 1000 pieces a year, it is really impressive.", "Now, of course, timing to 1/100th of a second is not something we need in our lives, but just like art, it is the complexity and the ingenuity that we appreciate. After all, isn\u2019t the wristwatch in itself an archaic tool? So why not, just go all out? It is for that reason, I think that the Centigraphe is one of the greatest watches that has come out of this century."], "productCr": "This F.P. Journe Centigraphe Souverain is in mint condition.

In fact, to this day, it is the beautiful and unconventional designs that attract collectors and a unique position in the watch brand hierarchy that no other possesses. ", "As I have mentioned many times, the \u201990s was an unconventional and murky time for watch brands, having just come out of the quartz crisis that decimated most of the industry. Brands were either experimenting like crazy or strictly conservative, wary of the fact they just survived the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. The industry was slowly coming back, with consumers beginning to take an interest in mechanical watches and with this in mind, Cartier decided that I was time to improve its image as a true watchmaking brand. ", "The result was the Collection Priv\u00e9 Cartier Paris division, referred to simply as the CPCP. The intention of the CPCP was to be the premier mechanical watchmaking division of Cartier and looking back on it today, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. The philosophy was simple, the CPCP took iconic models that were already loved by many, and reproduced them with high-grade movements, working with bonafide watch manufactures such as Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Piguet, Girard-Perregaux and more. ", "The easiest way to differentiate a CPCP watch was by the dial, with all but one model (Tank Cintr\u00e9e) featuring a \u2018Cartier Paris\u2019 inscription- an ode to its heritage. The dials were always crafted from solid gold and often featured a strong hand-turned guilloche pattern.", "The CPCP collection ran for 10 years between 1998 and 2008 and I can confidently say it is one of the most significant periods in Cartier\u2019s history. It\u2019s beautiful to see that Cartier was doing \u2018reissues\u2019 before it was even a thing and doing it the right way- respecting the past while producing something that is modern. Not only this, but the CPCP models were produced in truly limited numbers, with many having a designated run of 50 to 100 pieces.

Following a long list of gruelling tests, the Speedmaster was selected in 1965 to be NASA's standard-issue space-faring timepiece and the rest, as they say, is history.", "Omega has always had a relationship with space and also with the Snoopy character. While these Snoopy pieces have always been popular, with two iterations before the current example you see, not many know the historical context that underpins these iconic watches. ", "With Snoopy being a longtime mascot for NASA, the Silver Snoopy Award is a special honour given to individuals in and associated with NASA for outstanding achievements in space flight. ", "\u00a0", "Paying homage to the illustrious award with Snoopy in its 9 o'clock subdial, the 50th Anniversary Snoopy Speedmaster is perhaps the most distinctive of the three-anniversary models. With a dial made of silver, in reference to the Snoopy award, the hands and indices create a stark contrast to the dial thanks to their intense blue PVD coating. Continuing with this blue and silver theme, the subdials, bezel and nylon fabric are also the same blue colour as the hands and indices. While the watch looks stunning from the front, the real surprise comes when you flip the watch over.", "It features a depiction of the Moon, Earth, and a white Command and Service Module (CSM) with Snoopy riding along inside. With Snoopy's CSM moving across the case back when the chronograph is engaged, Omega's innovative attention to detail is refreshing. Travelling around the far side of the Moon, Omega makes a direct reference to the trip the Apollo 13 astronauts were forced to take all those years ago. In addition to this, the Earth itself spins once per minute as it is connected to the seconds hand subdial, providing a nice subtle visual touch.", "Powered by the modern moon watch movement, the manual-wind cal. 3861, this timepiece comes housed in an incredible Apollo 13 presentation box. A slimmed-down version of the large Moonwatch box, it features a Snoopy patch on top and an image of Snoopy on his dog house within. Supplied with a loupe, a pouch, and a soft cloth, this is as full a set as a timepiece can be.", "Today, while the Silver Snoopy Award 50th Anniversary Speedmaster is not a limited edition, it is produced in extremely low numbers that rival the Rolex Daytona and is perhaps the most in-demand piece from Omega today.

With Dubuis watches of today having garish designs and proportions that are all wrong, it is no wonder why. The truth is, Roger Dubuis, the man, left the company in 2005 and while he was undoubtedly a brilliant watchmaker, he lacked business expertise.", "It is this, and not his watchmaking skills, that caused the brand to be what it is today- devoid of emotion and controlled by business executives with no passion. You see, underneath this sheath of failure lies some of the most beautiful watches ever made. Early Roger Dubuis watches are nothing like what they are today- elegant in their design and finished to the highest standards, these watches rivaled and even bettered contemporaries such as Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet. In fact, collectors have finally started to realize this and as a result, prices have been skyrocketing. ", "An independent brand with aspiration, I have no doubt that today\u2019s indies have Dubuis and other pioneers of his time to thank for laying out the groundwork. Roger Dubuis formed his eponymous brand in 1995 after two decades at Patek Philippe and at the time, it not only took huge courage to start an independent brand but Dubuis had to also operate in an area that wasn\u2019t as mainstream as it is today.", "There were two main lines that Dubuis produced- the Homage series, which were more traditional round cased watches, and what you see here today- the Sympathie series. Featuring a more experimental case design, this is the most iconic Dubuis shape with an amorphous and angular shape.", "Constructed of 18kt rose gold, the Sympathie\u2019s 34mm case is a feast for the eyes. Featuring a vertical satin grain on the caseband and lug profiles with a contrasting high polish on the bezel, thick fixing screws, and lug hoods, the Sympathie is a finely executed timepiece with appreciable attention to detail. ", "Aside from its case, the Sympathie\u2019s dial also stands out as a unique piece of design. This variant is one of the rarest examples of Sympathie dials and it features exploding Arabic numerals atop a black glossy dial. ", "Powered by the automatic Roger Dubuis Cal. RD57, the Sympathie is as elegantly equipped within its case, as it is visually appealing from the outside. On display behind its sapphire crystal caseback, the RD57 is a finely finished piece of horology including black polished screws and swan's neck regulator, gorgeous c\u00f4tes de Geneve motif, and mirrored chamfering throughout. As referenced by the dial signature \"Bulletin D'Observatoire\", a Besan\u00e7on Observatory chronometer certificate from the French capital of watchmaking certifies the accuracy of this movement and goes to substantiate the level of quality on display by these early Roger Dubuis timepieces."], "productCr": "This Roger Dubuis Sympathie 34 is in excellent condition.

While both of these questions are rather subjective in their nature, there is one watch from a particular brand that demands the respect of every watch enthusiast out there, whether they like it or not. That watch is none other than the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak. Released in 1972, during the height of the Quartz Crisis, the Royal Oak was Audemars Piguet's Hail Mary attempt to save themselves from financial destitution.\u00a0", "With sales plummeting and brands falling to their knees, the writing was on the wall for Audemars Piguet, famed for their ultra-luxurious dress watches. Not content to go down fighting, however, AP executives enlisted the help of watch designer Gerald Genta to create a luxury steel sports watch, a first of its kind, in response to some market research AP had carried out in Italy. There was a slight problem; however, the launch of this watch was going ahead the next day.", "Sparing no time, Genta designed the Royal Oak after finding inspiration from an antique divers helmet and completed the sketch by the following morning. The Royal Oak, characterized by its octagonal bezel, exposed screws, unusual integrated bracelet, and exposed rubber gasket wasn't the immediate sales hit AP had hoped for.\u00a0", "The modern Royal Oak, the ref. 15500, was released in 2019 to replace the outgoing ref. 15400. Weighing in at a contemporary 41mm, the ref. 15500 balances Genta's famous design choices with everything a watch needs to be in today's day and age; sizeable yet elegant, thin yet robust, and above all else \u2013 extremely well made. Offered in 5 variants, here I have the pink gold variant mounted onto a black alligator leather strap held closed by a pink gold deployant clasp. The warm hue of the pink gold is ever so elegantly enhanced by the black Grande Tapisserie dial for which AP is famous for.

Featuring Rolex's tried and tested bright blue dial, this ref. 126000 features all of the necessary design motifs to excel in today's market. With its iconic oyster bracelet, domed stainless steel bezel, and clean time only design, the ref. 126000 with this electric blue dial exists as the perfect unisex option with its sporty design and unrivaled wearability and comfort on the wrist.", "Amongst the changes from the previous collection, the latest Oyster Perpetuals feature an upgraded movement with an improved 70-hour power reserve. The automatic cal. 3230 movement offers COSC and Rolex's own in-house Superlative Chronometer testing, which enables it to run at +/- 2 seconds per day. While the Oyster Perpetual might be marketed as an entry-level collection, its internals cut no corners, just like its iconic design and incredible history. Furthermore, I\u2019d say that while the Submariner and GMT-Master have somewhat gone on to become more of a luxury statement, the Oyster Perpetual remains true to Rolex\u2019s roots as a \u2018tool watch\u2019 with no superfluousness above all else."], "productCr": "This Rolex Oyster Perpetual 36 126000 is in mint condition.
